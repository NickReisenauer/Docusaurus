### Setting up a Web Server

In this video, we started off by creating our file and folder structure. We added a public folder and inside the public folder we added our index.html file. We also added a live server utility to server our public folder. This live server will allow for hot reloading.

---

### Hello React

In this video, we loaded in React and its companion library ReactDOM via script tags. Later on, we'll be loading them in via a different technique using Webpack. We also loaded in a script that we made in the scripts/app.js file. This script is very simple, we log a little message, and then we defined some JSX (JavaScript XML) but the real code that is running is the compiled version using Babel. We then select the element that we're going to render our template and then we used ReactDOM.render() to render the template we made inside the element we selected.

```js
// JSX
var template = <p id="Hello">This is JSX from app.js</p>;
// Babel compiled JSX
var template = /*#__PURE__*/ React.createElement(
  "p",
  {
    id: "Hello",
  },
  "This is JSX from app.js"
);
// Selecting the element to render the template in
var appRoot = document.getElementById("app");
// ReactDOM to render the template in the selected element
ReactDOM.render(template, appRoot);
```

---

### Setting up Babel

In this video we installed Babel as well as 2 Babel presets to compile our code. The presets we installed were `env` and `react`. Then we created a `src` folder to store the React code we're going to be writing. We ran `babel src/app.js --out-file=public/scripts/app.js --presets=env,react --watch` which tells babel where our source code is going to live and where we want the compiled code to go. The --watch flag will keep it running in the background so that it will compile into the scripts/app.js file every time we make a change in src/app.js.

---

### Exploring JSX

In this video, we explored JSX and how we can write our HTML inside. An important thing to remember for JSX is that we must have a root element. This means that if we're going to be writing multiple element we need to wrap them in a div tag or something similar. If we want Emmet autocompletion in our editor for writing HTML templates we can go into settings > extensions > emmet > add language support > javascript: javascriptreact.

Here's a basic template that is wrapped in a root div and then rendered using ReactDOM.

```js
let template2 = (
  <div>
    <h1>Nick Reisenauer</h1>
    <p>Age: 18</p>
    <p>Location: Phoenix</p>
  </div>
);

ReactDOM.render(template2, document.getElementById("app"));
```

---

### JSX Expressions

In this video, we looked at how we can dynamically pass data into our JSX expressions. We can pass in variables as long as the variables are references to strings or numbers. We can also store our data on an object and then call the properties on that object. We cannot directly render the object however. To actually include the variables in our JSX we use two curly braces between the tag. `<p>{variable}</p>`.

Here's an example of some data that is stored on an object and how we pass it in to our JSX.

```js
let app = {
  title: "Indecision App",
  subtitle: "Put your life in the hands of a computer",
};
let variable = 42;
let template = (
  <div>
    <h1>{app.title}</h1>
    <p>{app.subtitle}</p>
    <ol>
      <li>{variable}</li>
      <li>Item two</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
);
```

---

### Conditional Rendering in JSX

We can render our JSX based on a condition. We can do this in 3 ways, either with a function return expression, a ternary operator, or a logical && statement.

Here are examples for each method.

The function return method will call a function inside of JSX and render the return value. So in our function we have an if statement that checks if the user is older than 18 and if so it returns a JSX expression with a p tag and the user's age inside. We then call that function in our template and if it's false it won't render anything, but if it's true then it will render the user's age.

```js
// Function return expression
const user = {
  name: "Nick",
  age: 18,
};
function getAge(age) {
  if (age >= 18) return <p>Age: {age}</p>;
}
let template = <body>{getAge(user.age)}</body>;
```

The Ternary operator is a great option for if you want to display 2 messages, either a success or a failure. The way it works is if the condition is true it will render the first thing and if not it will render the second. We can use it to see if the user's name is a valid string and if it is we can render the name, otherwise we can render a 'stranger' string. We can also write this inline/in-tag in our JSX.

```js
// Ternary Operator
const user = {
  name: "Nick",
  age: 18,
};
let template = (
  <body>
    <p>{user.name ? user.name : "Hello stranger"}</p>
  </body>
);
```

The Logical && operator will take an expression and if it evaluates to true it will render the truthy value and if it's false it will return the falsy value. But JSX doesn't render falsy values so it has to be true for JSX to render it. We pass in our tag on the truthy side instead of wrapping this whole expression inside a tag. This is because if it evaluates to false we don't render anything and we only render the tag if it's true.
This will check if the user provided both a name and an age and if so it will render a p tag saying the user's age and name.

```js
// Logical &&
const user = {
  name: "Nick",
  age: 18,
};
let template = (
  <body>
    {user.name && user.age && (
      <p>
        Age: {user.age} and Name: {user.name}
      </p>
    )}
  </body>
);
```

### ES6 Aside: const and let

In this video, we looked at how `var`, `let`, and `const` differ from each other. The block and function scoping for `var` is different than `let` and `const`. For example if we have a function with a var declared inside we can access it from outside the block which we don't want to happen. With both let and const our variables are available in whatever scope we defined them in.

We should always try to use const unless we're going to be reassigning our variables, in which case we can use let. This will help us manage our scopes and not have variables bleeding out into scopes unknown.

---

### ES6 Aside: Arrow Functions

One big advantage of using arrow functions is that they have implicit return if we're returning a single value.

```js
const square = (x) => x * x;
```

---

### ES6 Aside: Arrow Functions Part 2

In this video, we explored some of the difference between using arrow functions and regular functions.

One of the first differences is that we no longer have access to the arguments object.

Another difference is how `this` works inside of object methods. If we have an ES5 function method and we use an arrow function inside, say with a map or forEach function, `this` will be able to reference whatever we want, but if we used an arrow function on our object method it would return undefined.

```js
const user = {
  name: "Nick",
  cities: ["Phoenix", "Glenwood Springs", "Frisco"],
  printPlacesLived() {
    return this.cities.map((city) => `${this.name} has lived in ${city}`);
  },
};
console.log(user.printPlacesLived());
// Nick has lived in Phoenix etc...
```

Another use case we talked about is `map`. `map` will return a new array with the values based on manipulating each element in an existing array.

```js
const multiplier = {
  numbers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
  multiplyBy: 5,
  multiply() {
    return this.numbers.map((num) => num * this.multiplyBy);
  },
};
console.log(multiplier.multiply());
// 5, 10, 15, 20, 25
```

---

### Events and Attributes

In this video, we learned about how we can add attributes to our JSX. In HTML we can add a class and id quite easily, the same is true for JSX except we have to use different names for some things. For example, `class` in HTML becomes `className` in JSX, id works the same.

We also learned about how we can set up inline event handlers using the `onClick` functionality to run a function every time a specified element is clicked.

```js
let count = 0;

const addOne = () => console.log("addOne");
const minusOne = () => console.log("minusOne");
const reset = () => console.log("reset");

const templateTwo = (
  <div>
    <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
    <button onClick={addOne} id="addOne">
      +1
    </button>
    <button onClick={minusOne} id="minusOne">
      -1
    </button>
    <button onClick={reset} id="reset">
      Reset
    </button>
  </div>
);
```

---

### Manual Data Binding

In this video, we learned that JSX doesn't automatically bind data for us. For example, when we say count++ in a function call, it won't render the new number because when we initially rendered the function the value was 0. To solve this, we wrapped our template and our call to ReactDOM.render into its own function call. Then when we need to update the state (number) of the application we can re-render our template to the screen with the new data.

You might be thinking that that's inefficient, and it is but not as bad as you think. When ReactDOM re-renders something, it looks at what it needs to actually change. In our case we don't need to change the div, or the h1, or the button, but only the number inside the button text. So that's all that gets changed.

```js
const reset = () => {
  count = 0;
  renderCounterApp();
};

const renderCounterApp = () => {
  const templateTwo = (
    <div>
      <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={addOne} id="addOne">
        +1
      </button>
      <button onClick={minusOne} id="minusOne">
        -1
      </button>
      <button onClick={reset} id="reset">
        Reset
      </button>
    </div>
  );
  ReactDOM.render(templateTwo, document.getElementById("app"));
};

renderCounterApp();
```

---

### Forms and Inputs

In this video, we learned about forms in JSX and how to get the value from the form as well as how to clear the form and add data from the form.

```js
const onFormSubmit = (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();

  const option = e.target.elements.option.value;

  if (option) {
    app.options.push(option);
    e.target.elements.option.value = "";
  }

  render();
};

const onReset = () => {
  app.options = [];
  render();
};

const render = () => {
  const template = (
    <div>
      <h1>{app.title}</h1>
      {app.subtitle && <p>{app.subtitle}</p>}
      <p>{app.options.length > 0 ? "Here are your options" : "No options"}</p>
      <p>{app.options.length}</p>
      <button onClick={onReset}>Remove All</button>
      <ol>
        <li>Item one</li>
        <li>Item two</li>
      </ol>
      <form onSubmit={onFormSubmit}>
        <input type="text" name="option" />
        <button>Add Option</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );

  ReactDOM.render(template, document.getElementById("app"));
};
```

We can access the value in the form with `e.target.elements.option.value`. From there we add it into an array. To actually call the function we use an `onClick` or an `onSubmit` event listener inline in our JSX markup.

---

### Arrays in JSX

In this video, we learned about how arrays work in JSX.

By default, JSX can work with arrays and if we simply try to render an array it will display all the items in one straight line next to each other. But we can do something more useful with arrays. Say we have an array containing options and we want to loop over each of them and render out a `<p>` tag, we can do that with our JSX inline function expressions.

We also learned about keys and how every element that we're generating from an array must have a unique key because React needs to be able to identify the elements from the array so that it can change them in an optimized fashion.

```js
<ol>
  {app.options.map((option) => {
    <li key={option}>{option}</li>;
  })}
</ol>
```

---

### Picking an Option

In this video, we learned about how we can make a function that will pick a random element from an array and display it in JSX, as well as how to disable the button if a certain condition is not met.

In order to get a random index from the array, we just use Math.floor and Math.random to pick a random number and we times that times the length of the array we're picking from.

In order to make a button disabled, we can use an inline event handler, called disabled. We can pass a value to disabled and if the value evaluates to true then the button is disabled, otherwise, the button is enabled.

```js
const onMakeDecision = () => {
  const randomNum = Math.floor(Math.random() * app.options.length);
  const option = app.options[randomNum];
  alert(option);
};

<button disabled={app.options.length === 0} onClick={onMakeDecision}>
  What should I do?
</button>;
```

---

### Build It: Visibility Toggle

In this video, our task was to build out our own project. The project was a visibility toggle, there's a button and it says show details and when you click it it shows a p tag with some text and the button text says hide details. Click it again and the button text changes and the details disappear.

Here's my implementation before watching the solution.

```js
let details = "Shown Details";
let text = "Show Details";

const onButtonClick = () => {
  if (text === "Show Details") text = "Hide Details";
  else text = "Show Details";
  render();
};

const render = () => {
  const template = (
    <div>
      <h1>Visibility Toggle</h1>
      <button onClick={onButtonClick}>{text}</button>
      {text === "Hide Details" && <p>{details}</p>}
    </div>
  );
  ReactDOM.render(template, document.getElementById("app"));
};

render();
```

Here is the final solution by Andrew Mead. I had similar ideas for the execution, I just didn't use a global variable to store the state and instead used the strings as identifiers.

```js
let visibility = false;

const toggleVisibility = () => {
  visibility = !visibility;
  render();
};

const render = () => {
  const jsx = (
    <div>
      <h1>Visibility Toggle</h1>
      <button onClick={toggleVisibility}>
        {visibility ? "Hide Details" : "Show Details"}
      </button>
      {visibility === true && <p>Hello I am details</p>}
    </div>
  );
  ReactDOM.render(jsx, document.getElementById("app"));
};

render();
```

## React Components

### Section Intro: React Components

Components allow us to take our complex applications and make them simple. Each component is responsible for defining the JSX that should be rendered when that component is used and components can also handle user interaction on anything that is rendered.

We'll refactor our current application to use components.

---

### Thinking in React

If we take a website like Twitter, we can look at how they might use components in their architecture.
They use these components so that they can easily be reused and simply dropped in on any page that is needed.
For example, some components might be the header, current trends, who to follow, each tweet is a tweet component, etc...

Component tags look like custom HTML code, a header might be `<Header />` and a tweet might be `<Tweet />`.

We also can have containing components, like `<DashboardPage />` and inside of that we can render our header, trends, etc. So we can just drop in components wherever we need to.

In our Indecision app we're going to have some of the following components: `<Header />`, `<Action />`, `<Options />`, and `<AddOption />`.
We're then going to have a wrapper/parent rendering component called `<IndecisionApp />` which will be in charge of rendering all of the child components.

---

### ES6 Classes: Part 1

In this video, we learned that we can create classes which are like blueprints and then create instances of our class and customize the data to our individual needs. We can also add methods to our class for custom functionality.

When we create a new Class, we have access to a constructor function. This is called every time we create a new class and is useful for assigning variables using `this`.

Here's a basic class where we create a person with a name and age. We use default values in our parameters so that if there is no data entered they will automatically be assigned some value instead of being undefined.

```js
class Person {
  constructor(name = "Anonymous", age = 0) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
  getGreeting() {
    return `Hello ${this.name}!`;
  }
  getDescription() {
    return `${this.name} is ${this.age} years old.`;
  }
}

const me = new Person("Nick Reisenauer", 18);
console.log(me.getDescription());
// Nick Reisenauer is 18 years old.

const other = new Person();
console.log(other.getDescription());
// Anonymous is 0 years old.
```

---

### ES6 Classes: Part 2

In this video, we learned that we can extend an existing class. That allows us to get all of the behavior of the parent class without needing to copy and paste the code. We can customize the behavior by adding new methods or overriding methods from the parent class.

If we want to create a class that is based on a parent class but with some customizations, we would use class extends. If we have a parent class that defines a car, we might wand an extended class that is a Toyota Camry. To do that it would be class Camry extends Car.

Once we extend our class we can pass in the constructor methods from our parent class using the `super` keyword and passing in the parent constructor function parameters.

We can then either use the functions provided to us from the parent function or we can add new ones.

Here's a class that extends a class.

```js
class Person {
  constructor(name = "Anonymous", age = 0) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
  getGreeting() {
    return `Hello ${this.name}!`;
  }
  getDescription() {
    return `${this.name} is ${this.age} years old.`;
  }
}

class Traveler extends Person {
  constructor(name, age, homeLocation) {
    super(name, age);
    this.homeLocation = homeLocation;
  }
  getGreeting() {
    let greeting = super.getGreeting();
    if (this.homeLocation) {
      greeting += ` I'm visiting from ${this.homeLocation}`;
    }
    return greeting;
  }
}

const joe = new Traveler("Joe", 42, "Phoenix");
console.log(joe.getGreeting());
// Hello Joe! I'm visiting from Phoenix
```
