## Welcome

### Welcome to the Class

1. Exploring the Course Curriculum
   This course is split into 4 main sections.
   In part 1, we're going to build a note taking app.
   In part 2, we're going to build a weather app.
   In part 3, we're going to build a task-manager app.
   In part 4, we're going to build a real-time chat app.

2. Learn by Writing Code
   In the beginning, we're going to learn by coping what we see. This is essential in exploring new features for the first time, but not good for building up your problem solving capabilities, which is why there are many personal challenges involved.

3. Tips for Asking Questions
   The course Q&A is where you can go to get help if your app randomly crashes, or something's not compiling correctly.

## Installing and Exploring Node.js

### Section Intro: Installing and Exploring Node.js

We'll be setting up Node.js and a text editor that works very well with Node.js.

---

### Installing Node.js and Visual Studio Code

To install Node.js, just download the most current version on nodejs.org and follow the install prompt. To make sure the latest version is installed, open the command prompt, and type `node -v`.

To install Visual Studio Code, just go to the website and follow the install instructions.

### What is Node.js?

Previously, JavaScript was limited to running on the browser. Node.js allows JavaScript to run outside of the browser on servers and machines. Node.js runs on the V8 JavaScript Engine from Chrome. This engine is written in C++ and helps the browser compile and read JavaScript code.

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime. This means that we write our code in regular JS and it will give us access to special tools and libraries.

![The V8 JavaScript Engine](./tcndc-am/static/tcndc-am1.png)

Node and JavaScript both rely heavily on the V8 engine. When we want to interact with some files, or something on the DOM, we are actually using C++ to do that, and when we write something in our code, we're just telling the V8 engine what it should do because it uses C++.

When we open the Command Prompt and type `node` in, we're put into what's called a REPL. Which stands for Read Evaluate Print Loop, and it lets us run some simple node commands.

What are some of the differences? With regular JS, we can call the `window` or `document` property and it will give us lots of options to do with the browser window,but this isn't available in Node.js because we don't interact with the browser window.

Some node functions include `process`, and `process.exit()`

---

### Why Should I Use Node.js

"Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient." I/O stands for Input Output, and Node uses I/O anytime it communicates with the outside world. Non-blocking means that while Node is waiting for something to happen, it can continue processing other things.

![Blocking vs Non-Blocking](./tcndc-am/static/tcndc-am2.png)

NPM came preinstalled with Node. NPM contains packages for almost everything and is a very useful tool.

---

### Your First Node.js Script

We're going to set up a folder on the desktop, someplace to keep all of our scripts, and then open that in VSCode.

The first Node script is a simple `console.log()`, but it's important to note that console.log is not exclusive to JavaScript and isn't even part of the language itself, it's part of the runtime.

The Node documentation is available on the website, just select the version that is installed.

To run a simple Node script using the integrated terminal in VSCode, simply type `node` and add the file name that you want to run, `node hello.js`.

---

## Node.js Module System (Notes App)

### Section Intro: Node.js Module System

In this section, the focus will be on the Node module system in three different ways. Importing core Node modules, 3rd party modules by other developers, and our own modules.

---

### Importing Node.js Core Modules

Node.js comes with dozens of built-in modules. These built-in modules, sometimes
referred to as core modules, give you access to tools for working with the file system,
making http requests, creating web servers, and more! In this lesson, you’ll learn how to load in those core modules and use them in your code.

Importing Node.js Core Modules
To get started, let’s work with some built-in Node.js modules. These are modules that
come with Node, so there’s no need to install them.

The module system is built around the require function. This function is used to load in a module and get access to its contents. require is a global variable provided to all your Node.js scripts, so you can use it anywhere you like!
Let’s look at an example.

```js
const fs = require("fs");
fs.writeFileSync("notes.txt", "I live in Philadelphia");
```

The script above uses require to load in the fs module. This is a built-in Node.js module
that provides functions you can use to manipulate the file system. The script uses
writeFileSync to write a message to notes.txt.

After you run the script, you’ll notice a new notes.txt file in your directory. Open it up and you’ll see, “I live in Philadelphia!”.

---

### Importing Your Own Files

Putting all your code in a single file makes it easy to get started with Node.js. As you add more code, you’ll want to stay organized and break your Node.js app into multiple scripts that all work together. In this lesson, you’ll learn how to create a Node.js application that’s spread out across multiple files.

Importing Your Own Files
You know how to use `require` to load in built-in modules. `require` can also be used to
load in JavaScript files you’ve created. All you need to do is provide `require` with a
relative path to the script you want to load. This path should start with ./ and then link to the file that needs to be loaded in.

```js
const checkUtils = require("./src/utils.js");
checkUtils();
```

The code above uses `require` to load in a file called `utils.js` in the src directory. It stores the module contents in a variable, and then uses the contents in the script.

Exporting from Files
Node.js runs the scripts that you require. That means the require call above will cause
`utils.js` to run. Node.js provides the required script with a place to store values that should be exported as part of the library. This is on `module.exports`.

You can see `utils.js` below. A function is defined and then assigned to `module.exports`. The value stored on `module.exports` will be the return value for `require` when the script is imported. That means other scripts could load in the utilities to access the `check` function.

```js
const check = function () {
  console.log("Doing some work...");
};
module.exports = check;
```

If you run the original script, you’ll see the message that logged from the `check` function in `utils.js`.

```js
Version 1.0 12
\$ node app.js
Doing some work...
```

Your Node.js scripts don’t share a global score. This means variables created in one
scripts are not accessible in a different script. The only way to share values between
scripts is by using `require` with `module.exports`.

---

### Importing npm Modules

When you install Node.js, you also get npm. npm is a package manager that allows you to
install and use third-party npm libraries in your code. This opens up a world of possibilities, as there are npm packages for everything from email sending to file uploading. In this lesson, you’ll learn how to integrate npm into your Node.js app.

Initializing npm

Your Node.js application needs to initialize npm before npm can be used. You can run `npm init` from the root of your project to get that done. That command will ask you a series of questions about the project and it’ll use the information to generate a `package.json` file in the root of your project.

Here’s an example.

```js
{
"name": "notes-app",
"version": "1.0.0",
"description": "",
"main": "app.js",
"scripts": {
"test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
},
"author": "",
"license": "ISC",
}
```

Installing an npm Module

You’re now ready to install an npm module. This is done using the `npm` command which
was set up when Node.js was installed. You can use `npm install` to install a new module
in your project.

`npm install validator@10.8.0`

The command above installs version 10.8.0 of validator. If you want to install the latest
version of a module, you can leave off the version number as shown below.

`npm install validator`

This command does three important things:
First, it creates a `node_modules` directory. npm uses this directory to store all the code for the npm modules you have installed.

Second, npm adds the module as a dependency by listing it in the `dependencies` property
in `package.json`. This allows you to track and manage the module you have installed.

Third, npm creates a `package-lock.json` file. This includes detailed information about the modules you’ve installed which helps keep things fast and secure.

You should never make changes to `node_modules` or `package-lock.json`. Both are
managed by npm and will get changed as you run npm commands from the terminal.

Importing an npm Module

npm modules can be imported into your script using `require`. To load in an npm module,
pass the npm module name to `require`.

```js
const validator = require("validator");
console.log(validator.isURL("https/mead.io")); // Print: true
```

The script above uses `require` to load in validator. The script then uses the `isURL` function provided by validator to check if a given string contains a valid URL.

- [npm: validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/validator)

### Printing in Color

In this lesson, we were tasked with installing and using an npm package that we have no experience with. The package was called `chalk` and was a library that allows us to style our console.log messages with colors and background colors and cool text decorations.
To start, visit the [NPM chalk page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk) and follow the download instructions. `npm install chalk`. From there we need to require the package inside of our file using the `require` keyword. `const chalk = require("chalk")`
Then, we can write a console.log and pass in the arguments we want. The API docs are very beneficial in explaining what each property available is. To console.log a green background with bold white text, I used this code.

```js
// npm install chalk
const chalk = require("chalk");
console.log(chalk.whiteBright.bold.bgGreen("Success!"));
```

---

### Global npm Modules and nodemon

You can use npm modules from outside of your scripts by installing them globally. Globally installed modules are designed to be used from the terminal and provide you with new commands you can run. In this lesson, you’ll learn how to install and work with global modules.

Installing an npm Module Globally
npm modules can be installed globally by adding a `-g` flag to the installation command.
Not all modules are designed to be installed globally, so be sure to refer to the module
documentation to learn how it’s supposed to be used.

The command below installs version 1.18.5 of nodemon as a global module.

`npm install -g nodemon@1.18.5`

A globally installed module is not added as a dependency to your project. That means you
won’t see it listed in `package.json` or `package-lock.json`. You also won’t find its code in `node_modules`. Globally installed modules are located in a special directory in your machine which is created and managed by npm.

When you install nodemon globally, you get access a new `nodemon` command from the
terminal. This can be used to start and Node.js application and then restart the application any of the app scripts change. This means you won’t need to switch between the terminal and text editor to restart your application every time you make a change.

The command below runs `app.js` through nodemon.

`nodemon app.js`

P.S. You can stop nodemon by using `ctrl + c` from the terminal!

## File System and Command Line Args (Notes App)

### Section Intro: File System and Command Line Args

This section focuses on 2 main topics. The first is using the file system, and the second is command line arguments. The file system allows us to store the users note data and command line arguments are going to allow us to get data from the user.

---

### Getting Input from Users

I can’t think of a single useful application that doesn’t get input from the users. Whether it’s their email, location, or age, getting input is essential for creating real-world apps. In this lesson, you’ll learn how to set up command line arguments that allow users to pass data into your application.

Accessing Command Line Arguments

Command line arguments are values passed into your application from the terminal. Your
Node.js application can access the command line arguments that were provided using
`process.argv`. This array contains at least two items. The first is the path to the Node.js executable. The second is the path to the JavaScript file that was executed. Everything after that is a command line argument.

Take a look at the example below.

```js
const command = process.argv[2];

if (command === "add") {
  console.log("Adding note!");
} else if (command === "remove") {
  console.log("Removing note!");
}
```

That script grabs the third item in `process.argv`. Since the first two are always provided, the third item is the first command line argument that was passed in. The script uses the value of that argument to figure out what it should do. A user could provide add to add a note or remove to remove a note.

The command below runs the script and provides add as the command line argument.

```node
node app.js add
Adding note!
```

[process.argv](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_argv)

### Argument Parsing with Yargs: Part 1

Node.js provides a bare-bones way to access command line arguments. While it’s a good
start, it doesn’t provide any way to parse more complex command line arguments. In this
lesson, you’ll learn how to use Yargs to easily set up a more complex set of arguments for your application.

Setting Up Yargs
First, install Yargs in your project.

`npm install yargs@12.0.2`

Now, yargs can be used to make it easier to work with command line arguments. The
example below shows how this can be done. First, `yargs.version` is used to set up a
version for the command line tool. Next, `yargs.command` is used to add support for a new command.

```js
const yargs = require("yargs");
yargs.version("1.1.0");
yargs.command({
  command: "add",
  describe: "Add a new note",
  handler: function () {
    console.log("Adding a new note!");
  },
});
console.log(yargs.argv);
```

Now, this command can be triggered by providing its name as a command line argument.

```terminal
node app.js add
Adding a new note!
```

Yargs provides a couple useful commands by default. The first, shown below, lets a user
get the version of the command line tool they’re running.

```terminal
node app.js --version
1.1.0
```

The second, shown below, shows the user autogenerated documentation that covers how
the tool can be used. This would list out all available commands as well as the available options for each command.

```terminal
node app.js --help
```

---

### Argument Parsing with Yargs: Part 2

In this lesson, you’ll continue to explore Yargs. The goal is to allow users to pass in the title and body of their notes using command line options. This same technique could be used to allow users to pass in data such as their name, email, or address.

Adding Command Options
Options are additional pieces of information passed along with the command. You can set
up options for a command using the `builder` property as shown below.

Now, the add command can be used with two options. The first is `title` which is used for the title of the note being added. The second is `body` which is used for the body of the note being added. Both options are required because `demandOption` is set to `true`. Both are also set up to accept string input because `type` is set to `'string'`.

```js
yargs.command({
  command: "add",
  describe: "Add a new note",
  builder: {
    title: {
      describe: "Note title",
      demandOption: true,
      type: "string",
    },
    body: {
      describe: "Note body",
      demandOption: true,
      type: "string",
    },
  },
  handler: function (argv) {
    console.log("Title: " + argv.title);
    console.log("Body: " + argv.body);
  },
});
```

The add command can now be used with `--title` and `--body`.

```js
node app.js add --title="Buy" --body="Note body here"

Title: Buy
Body: Note body here
```

---

### Storing Data with JSON

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to work with JSON. JSON, which stands for JavaScript
Object Notation, is a lightweight data format. JSON makes it easy to store or transfer data.
You’ll be using it in this application to store users notes in the file system.

Working with JSON

Since JSON is nothing more than a string, it can be used to store data in a text file or
transfer data via an HTTP requests between two machines.

JavaScript provides two methods for working with JSON. The first is `JSON.stringify` and
the second is `JSON.parse`. `JSON.stringify` converts a JavaScript object into a JSON
string, while `JSON.parse` converts a JSON string into a JavaScript object.

```js
const book = {
  title: "Ego is the Enemy",
  author: "Ryan Holiday",
};
// Covert JavaScript object into JSON string
const bookJSON = JSON.stringify(book);
// Covert JSON string into object
const bookObject = JSON.parse(bookJSON);
console.log(bookObject.title); // Print: Ego is the Enemy
```

JSON looks similar to a JavaScript object, but there are some differences. The most
obvious is that all properties are wrapped in double-quotes. Single-quotes can’t be used
here, as JSON only supports double-quotes. You can see this in the example JSON
below.

```js
{"name":"Gunther","planet":"Earth","age":54}
```

---

### Adding a Note

In this lesson we set up a function to add a new note, and we also set up a process to check if the note is a duplicate note. If the note is a duplicate, then it doesn't add the new note to the json file.

---

### Removing a Note

Our challenge was to wire up a function that removed a note. To do this, we first set up a handler to make a title string a required functionality. Then we made a function that checks if the note title matches a note that's already in our object. Then we remove it.

---

### ES6 Aside: Arrow Functions

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to use ES6 arrow functions. Arrow functions come with a
few great features, making them a nice alternative to the standard ES5 function. You’ll
explore the new syntax and learn when to use them!

Arrow Functions

Arrow functions offer up an alternative syntax from the standard ES5 function. The snippet
below shows an example of a standard function and then an arrow function. While the
syntax is obviously different, you still have the two important pieces, an arguments list and
a function body.

```js
// const square = function (x) {
// return x * x
// }
const square = (x) => {
  return x * x;
};
console.log(square(2)); // Will print: 4
```

Shorthand Syntax

Arrow functions have an optional shorthand syntax. This is useful when you have a
function that immediately returns a value. The example below shows how this can be
used.

```js
const squareAlt = (x) => x * x;
console.log(squareAlt(2)); // Will print: 4
```

Notice that two important things are missing from the function definition. First, the curly
braces wrapping the function body have been removed as well as the `return` statement.
In place of both is the value to be returned. There’s no need for an explicit return
statement, as the value provide is implicitly returned.

This Binding

Arrow functions don’t bind their own `this` value. Instead, the `this` value of the scope in
which it was defined is accessible. This makes arrow functions bad candidates for
methods, as `this` won’t be a reference to the object the method is defined on.

For methods, ES6 provides a new method definition syntax. You can see this in the
definition of the `printGuestList` method below. That function is a standard function, just
with a shorthand syntax which allows for the removal of the colon and the function
keyword.

Because arrow functions don’t bind this, they work well for everything except methods. As
shown below, the arrow function passed to `forEach` is able to access `this.name` correctly,
as it’s defined as an arrow function and doesn’t have a this binding of its own. That code
wouldn’t work if you swapped out the arrow function for a standard function.

```js
const event = {
  name: "Birthday Party",
  guestList: ["Andrew", "Jen", "Mike"],
  printGuestList() {
    console.log("Guest list for " + this.name);

    this.guestList.forEach((guest) => {
      console.log(guest + " is attending " + this.name);
    });
  },
};
event.printGuestList();
```

[MDN Arrow Function Expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions)

---

### Refactoring to Use Arrow Functions

In this module we learned about refactoring and arrow functions. We changed all of our regular function expressions to arrows.

Regular vs Arrow

```js
function hello(name) {
  console.log(name);
}

(param) => {
  console.log(param);
};

// Or, if all we're doing is returning one value we can use an even shorter syntax
(param) => param + "Hi";
// This just returns param + the string hi
```

---

### Listing Notes

We were required to write a function that will list out all of the notes when we run the list command.

```js
const listNotes = () => {
  const notes = loadNotes();
  console.log(chalk.green.inverse("Your Notes"));
  notes.forEach((element) => {
    console.log(element.title);
  });
};
```

After exporting it and adding it as an event handler, this will return all of the note titles.

---

### Reading a Note

In this lesson, you’ll add a new app feature that allows users to read a note.

Array Find method

The find method allows you to find a single item in an array. It’s similar to `filter`, though `find` returns a single element as opposed to an array of elements. `find` will stop its search `through` the array after finding the first match.

The example below shows how find can be used to locate the user whose name is
George Hudson.

```js
const users = [
  {
    name: "Andrew Mead",
    age: 27,
  },
  {
    name: "George Hudson",
    age: 72,
  },
  {
    name: "Clay Klay",
    age: 45,
  },
];
const user = users.find((user) => user.name === "George Hudson");
console.log(user); // Will print the second object in the array
```

## Debugging Node.js (Notes App)

### Section Intro

What’s worse than getting an error when you run your application? Not knowing how to fix
it. In this section, you’ll learn how to effectively debug your Node.js apps. You’ll learn how to track down and fix issues so you can get back to the important work.

---

### Debugging Node.js

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to debug your Node.js applications. Node comes with a
great set of tools for getting to the bottom of any bug or programming issue.

Console.log

While it’s nice to have advanced debugging tools at the ready, there’s nothing wrong with
using `console.log` to debug your application. It’s not the fanciest technique, but it works,
and I use it daily.

When in doubt, use a few calls to `console.log` to figure out what’s going on. It’s great for
dumping a variable to the terminal so you can check its value. It also works for figuring out
what order your code is running in.

Node Debugger

Printing values to the console with `console.log` is a good start, but there are often times
where we need a more complete debugging solution. For that, Node.js ships with a built-in
debugger. It builds off of the developer tools that Chrome and V8 use when debugging
JavaScript code in the browser.

Start your application with inspect to use the debugger.

`node inspect app.js`

Next, visit `chrome://inspect` in the Chrome browser. There, you’ll see a list of all the
Node.js processes that you’re able to debug. Click “inspect” next to your Node.js process
to open up the developer tools. From there, you can click the blue “play” button near the
top-right of the “sources” tab to start up the application.

When running the app in debug mode, you can add breakpoints into your application to
stop it at a specific point in the code. This gives you a chance to explore to the application
state and figure out what’s going wrong.

```js
console.log('Thing one)
debugger // Debug tools will pause here until your click play again
console.log('Thing two)
```

[Node.js debugger documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/debugger.html)

### Error Messages

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to read error messages. Error messages contain useful
information about what went wrong, but they can be a pain to read. Learning how to read
them will let you fix errors fast.

Error Messages

Error messages can be daunting to use at first. They contain a lot of useful information, but
only if you know what you’re looking at. Let’s start with a complete error. Below is an error
I generated by trying to reference a variable that was never defined.

```js
/Users/Andrew/Downloads/n3-04-08-arrow-functions/playground/2-arrowfunction.js:21
 console.log(guest + ' is attending ' + eventName)
 ^
ReferenceError: eventName is not defined
 at guestList.forEach (/Users/Andrew/Downloads/n3-04-08-arrowfunctions/playground/2-arrow-function.js:21:52)
 at Array.forEach (<anonymous>)
 at Object.printGuestList (/Users/Andrew/Downloads/n3-04-08-arrowfunctions/playground/2-arrow-function.js:20:24)
 at Object.<anonymous> (/Users/Andrew/Downloads/n3-04-08-arrowfunctions/playground/2-arrow-function.js:26:7)
 at Module._compile (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:707:30)
 at Object.Module._extensions..js (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:718:10)
 at Module.load (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:605:32)
 at tryModuleLoad (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:544:12)
 at Function.Module._load (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:536:3)
 at Function.Module.runMain (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:760:12)
```

The first few lines of the error contain the most useful information.

The first line contains a path to the exact script where the error was thrown. It also
contains the line number. Using that line, you could tell that the issue is on line 21 of `2-arrow-function.js`.

The second line shows the line of code that caused the error.

The third line just below uses the “^” character to point to the specific part of the line that
the error came from.

The fourth line is blank.

The fifth line contains the error message from V8.

Everything after the fifth line is part of the stack trace. This shows a list of all the functions
that were running to get to the point where the program crashed. The top of the stack
trace starts with the function which threw the error. Here, we can see that the error was
thrown in a callback function for a `forEach` method call. If you got down to the next line,
you’ll figure out that the `forEach` call happened inside of `printGuestList`.

It’ll take a few tries to get comfortable with error messages. Each error you fix makes it
easier to fix the next one.

## Asynchronous Node.js

### Section Intro: Asynchronous Node.js

If we read an article about what Node.js is, we'll likely see these 4 terms.
Asynchronous, Non-Blocking, Single-Threaded, and Event Driven.
What do these terms mean and how do they affect the Node apps we're building?
We'll figure out how these terms fit into our apps by building a weather app with a frontend and a backend that will handle our frontend requests.

It’s time to connect your application with the outside world. In this section, you’ll explore
the asynchronous nature of Node.js. You’ll learn how to use asynchronous programming
to make HTTP API requests to third-party HTTP APIs. This will allow you to pull in data, like
real-time weather data, into your app.

---

### Asynchronous Basics

In this lesson, you’ll explore the basics of asynchronous development. You’ll get a preview
of what asynchronous code looks like and how it’s different from synchronous code.

Async 101

When running asynchronous code, your code won’t always execute in the order you might
expect. To get started with asynchronous development, let’s use `setTimeout`.

`setTimeout` is a function that allows you to run some code after a specific amount of time
has passed. `setTimeout` accepts two arguments. The first is a callback function. This
function will run after the specified amount of time has passed. The second argument is
the amount of time in milliseconds to wait.
Here’s an example.

```js
console.log("Starting");
// Wait 2 seconds before running the function
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("2 Second Timer");
}, 2000);
console.log("Stopping");
```

Run the script and you’ll see the logs in the following order.

```js
$ node app.js
Starting
Stopping
2 Second Timer
```

Notice that “Stopping” prints before “2 Second Timer”. That’s because `setTimeout` is
asynchronous and non-blocking. The `setTimeout` call doesn’t block Node.js from running
other code while it’s waiting for the 2 seconds to pass.

This asynchronous and non-blocking nature makes Node.js ideal for backend
development. Your server can wait for data from a database while also processing an
incoming HTTP request.

### Making HTTP Requests

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to make HTTP requests from Node. This will enable your
app to communicate with other APIs and servers to do a wide variety of things. Everything
from fetching real-time weather data to sending text messages to users.

Making HTTP Requests

There are several libraries that make it easy to fire off HTTP requests. My favorite is
request. You can install it using the command below.

`npm i request@2.88.0`

Before you use the library in your app, you’ll need to figure out which URL you’re trying to
fetch. To fetch real-time weather data, you’ll need to sign up for a free Dark Sky API
account. You can do that [here](https://darksky.net/dev).

Below is an example URL that responds with forecast data for San Francisco.

[https://api.darksky.net/forecast/9d1465c6f3bb7a6c71944bdd8548d026/37.8267,-122.4233](https://api.darksky.net/forecast/9d1465c6f3bb7a6c71944bdd8548d026/37.8267,-122.4233)

If you visit that URL in the browser, you’ll see that the response is JSON data. This same
data can be fetched by our Node.js app using the request library. The example below
fetches the forecast data and prints the current temperature to the console.

```js
const request = require('request')
const url =
'https://api.darksky.net/forecast/9d1465c6f3bb7a6c71944bdd8548d026/37.8267,-
122.4233';
request({ url: url }, (error, response) => {
 // Parse the response body from JSON string into JavaScript object
 const data = JSON.parse(response.body)
 // Will print the current temperature to the console
 console.log(data.currently.temperature)
})
```

---

### Customizing HTTP Requests

In this lesson, you’ll explore an option for the request library that allows it to automatically
parse JSON data into a JavaScript object.

Request Options

The request library comes with plenty of options to make your life easier. One is the `json`
option. Set `json` to `true` and request will automatically parse the JSON into a JavaScript
object for you.

```js
const request = require("request");
const url =
  "https://api.darksky.net/forecast/9d1465c6f3bb7a6c71944bdd8548d026/37.8267,-122.4233";
request({ url: url, json: true }, (error, response) => {
  console.log(
    response.body.daily.data[0].summary +
      " It is currently " +
      response.body.currently.temperature +
      " degrees out. There is a " +
      response.body.currently.precipProbability +
      "% chance of rain."
  );
});
```

The above program would print the following.

`Mostly cloudy overnight. It is currently 51.49 degrees out. There is a 0% chance of rain.`

There’s a link below where you can explore all available options.

[npm: request options](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request#requestoptions-callback)

### An HTTP Request Challenge

Our challenge was to be able to get the latitude and longitude values of a specific location using the Mapbox geolocation API.

I used the `request` npm module for this, but `Axios` is probably easier.

My request looked like this in the end.

```js
const geoURL =
  "https://api.mapbox.com/geocoding/v5/mapbox.places/Los%20Angeles.json?access_token=pk.eyJ1Ijoibmlja3JlaXNlbmF1ZXIiLCJhIjoiY2s3a3JqY294MDAxYzNobXUwb2UzYzV6biJ9.YQi9oFC0rW41CTNhzHAFng&limit=1";

request({ url: geoURL, json: true }, (error, response) => {
  const latitude = response.body.features[0].center[1];
  const longitude = response.body.features[0].center[0];
  console.log(
    `The lat and long of ${response.body.features[0].place_name} is ${longitude} longitude and ${latitude} latitude`
  );
});
```

---

### Handling Errors

There are plenty of reasons an HTTP request can fail. Maybe your machine doesn’t have
an internet connection, or maybe the URL is incorrect. Regardless of what goes wrong, in
this lesson, you’ll learn how to handle errors that occur when making HTTP requests.

Handling Errors

Handling errors is important. It would be nice if we could always provide the user with a
forecast for their location, but that’s not going to happen. When things fail, you should aim
to provide users with clear and useful messages in plain English so they know what’s
going on.

The callback function you pass to `request` expects an `error` and `response` argument to
be provided. Either `error` or `response` will have a value, never both. If `error` has a value,
that means things went wrong. In this case, `response` will be `undefined`, as there is no
response. If `response` has a value, things went well. In this case, `error` will be `undefined`,
as no error occurred.

The code below handles two different errors. The if statement first checks if error exists. If
it does, the program prints a message letting the user know it was unable to connect. The
second error occurs if there’s no match for the given address. In that case, the program
prints a message instructing the user to try a different search. Lastly, the coordinates are
printed to the console if neither error occurs.

```js
const request = require("request");
const geocodeURL =
  "https://api.mapbox.com/geocoding/v5/mapbox.places/philadelphia.json?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoiYW5kcmV3bWVhZDEiLCJhIjoiY2pvOG8ybW90MDFhazNxcnJ4OTYydzJlOSJ9.njY7HvaalLEVhEOIghPTlw&limit=1";

request({ url: geocodeURL, json: true }, (error, response) => {
  if (error) {
    console.log("Unable to connect to location services!");
  } else if (response.body.features.length === 0) {
    console.log("Unable to find location. Try another search.");
  } else {
    const latitude = response.body.features[0].center[0];
    const longitude = response.body.features[0].center[1];
    console.log(latitude, longitude);
  }
});
```

---

### The Callback Function

A callback function is a function that’s passed as an argument to another function. That’s it.
This is something you’ve used before, and in this lesson, you’ll dive a bit deeper into how
they work.

The Callback Function

A callback function is a function that’s passed as an argument to another function. Imagine
you have FunctionA which gets passed as an argument to FunctionB. FunctionB will do
some work and then call FunctionA at some point in the future.

Callback functions are at the core of asynchronous development. When you perform an
asynchronous operation, you’ll provide Node with a callback function. Node will then call
the callback when the async operation is complete. This is how you get access to the
results of the async operation, whether it’s an HTTP request for JSON data or a query to a
database for a user’s profile.

The example below shows how you can use the callback pattern in your own code. The
`geocode` function is set up to take in two arguments. The first is the address to geocode.
The second is the callback function to run when the geocoding process is complete. The
example below simulates this request by using `setTimeout` to make the process
asynchronous.

```js
const geocode = (address, callback) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    const data = {
      latitude: 0,
      longitude: 0,
    };
    callback(data);
  }, 2000);
};
geocode("Philadelphia", (data) => {
  console.log(data);
});
```

The call to `geocode` provides both arguments, the address and the callback function.
Notice that the callback function is expecting a single parameter which it has called `data`.
This is where the callback function will get access to the results of the asynchronous
operation. You can see where `callback` is called with the data inside the `geocode`
function.

### Callback Abstraction

Callback functions can be used to abstract complex asynchronous code into a simple
reusable function. In this lesson, you’ll learn how to use this pattern to create a reusable
function for geocoding an address.

Callback Abstraction

Imagine you want to geocode an address from multiple places in your application. You
have two options. Option one, you can duplicate the code responsible for making the
request. This includes the call to request along with all the code responsible for handling
errors. However, this isn’t ideal. Duplicating code makes your application unnecessarily
complex and difficult to maintain. The solution is to create a single reusable function that
can be called whenever you need to geocode an address.

You can see an example of this below. The function `geocode` was created to serve as a
reusable way to geocode an address. It contains all the logic necessary to make the
request and process the response. `geocode` accepts two arguments. The first is the
address to geocode. The second is a callback function which will run once the geocoding
operation is complete.

```js
const request = require("request");

const geocode = (address, callback) => {
  const url = `https://api.mapbox.com/geocoding/v5/mapbox.places/${encodeURIComponent(
    address
  )}.json?access_token=pk.eyJ1Ijoibmlja3JlaXNlbmF1ZXIiLCJhIjoiY2s3a3JqY294MDAxYzNobXUwb2UzYzV6biJ9.YQi9oFC0rW41CTNhzHAFng&limit=1`;
  request({ url: url, json: true }, (error, response) => {
    if (error) {
      callback("Unable to connect to location services", undefined);
    } else if (response.body.features.length === 0) {
      callback("Unable to find location. Try another search", undefined);
    } else {
      callback(undefined, {
        latitude: response.body.features[0].center[0],
        longitude: response.body.features[0].center[1],
        location: response.body.features[0].place_name,
      });
    }
  });
};

module.exports = geocode;
```

Now, `geocode` can be called as many times as needed from anywhere in your application.
The snippet below imports `geocode` and calls the function to get the latitude and longitude
for Boston.

```js
const geocode = require("./utils/geocode");
geocode("Boston", (error, data) => {
  console.log("Error", error);
  console.log("Data", data);
});
```

---

### Callback Abstraction Challenge

Our challenge was to provide a forecast util that will allow us to run a simple function that will fetch the forecast with arguments for lat and long.

```js
const request = require("request");

const forecast = (latitude, longitude, callback) => {
  const url = `https://api.darksky.net/forecast/48142fb7162954af695a6d0aeffd9a6e/${latitude},${longitude}?units=us`;
  request({ url: url, json: true }, (error, response) => {
    if (error) {
      callback("Unable to connect to location services", undefined);
    } else if (response.body.error) {
      callback("Unable to find location, try another search", undefined);
    } else {
      callback(
        undefined,
        `It is currently ${response.body.currently.temperature} degrees out. There is a ${response.body.currently.precipProbability}% chance of rain`
      );
    }
  });
};

module.exports = forecast;
```

And our function call

```js
forecast(-75.7088, 44.1545, (error, data) => {
  console.log("Error", error);
  console.log("Data", data);
});
```

---

### Callback Chaining

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to run one asynchronous operation only after another
asynchronous operation is complete. That’ll allow you to use the output from geocoding
as the input for fetching the weather.

Callback Chaining

When working with async code, you’ll often find out that you need to use the results from
one async operation as the input for another async operation. This is something we need
to do in the weather application too. Step one is to geocode the address. Step two is to
use the coordinates to fetch the weather forecast. You can’t start step two until step one is
complete.

You can start one operation after another finishes by using callback chaining. You can see
an example of this in the code below.

```js
// Other lines hidden for brevity
geocode(address, (error, data) => {
  if (error) {
    return console.log(error);
  }
  forecast(data.latitude, data.longitude, (error, forecastData) => {
    if (error) {
      return console.log(error);
    }
    console.log(data.location);
    console.log(forecastData);
  });
});
```

First up is the call to `geocode`. The call to `geocode` provides an address and a callback
function as it did before. It’s the code inside the callback function that looks a bit different.
The callback `function` calls forecast. This means that `forecast` won’t get called until after
`geocode` is complete. The latitude and longitude from the geocoding operation is also
provided as the input for the `forecast` function call.

### ES6 Aside: Object Property Shorthand and Destructuring

ES6 has done wonders making JavaScript easier to use. In this lesson, you’ll explore a
couple of features that make it easier to work with objects.

Property Shorthand

The property shorthand makes it easier to define properties when creating a new object. It
provides a shortcut for defining a property whose value comes from a variable of the same
name. You can see this in the example below where a `user` object is created. The `name`
property gets its value from a variable also called `name`.

```js
const name = "Andrew";
const userAge = 27;
const user = {
  name: name,
  age: userAge,
  location: "Philadelphia",
};
```

The shorthand allows you to remove the colon and the reference to the variable. When
JavaScript sees this, it’ll get the property value from the variable with the same name. The
example below uses the property shorthand to define `name` on the `user` object.

```js
const name = "Andrew";
const userAge = 27;
const user = {
  name,
  age: userAge,
  location: "Philadelphia",
};
console.log(user);
```

Object Destructuring

The second ES6 feature is object destructuring. Object destructuring gives you a syntax
for pulling properties off of objects and into standalone variables. This is useful when
working with the same object properties throughout your code. Instead of writing
`user.name` a dozen times, you could destructure the property into a `name` variable.

You can see an example of this below

```js
const user = {
  name: "Andrew",
  age: 27,
  location: "Philadelphia",
};
// The line below uses destructuring
const { age, location: address } = user;
console.log(age);
console.log(address);
```

`user` is destructured on line 8 above. The `age` property has been destructured and stored
in `age`. The `location` property has also been destructured and stored in `address`.

Destructuring Function Arguments

Destructuring works with function parameters as well. If an object is passed into a function,
it can be destructured inside the function definition. You can see this in the `transaction`
function below. The function accepts an object as its second argument. The `label` and
`stock` properties have both been destructured into standalone variables that become
available in the function.

```js
const product = {
  label: "Red notebook",
  price: 3,
  stock: 201,
  salePrice: undefined,
  rating: 4.2,
};
const transaction = (type, { label, stock }) => {
  console.log(type, label, stock);
};
transaction("order", product);
```

### Bonus: HTTP Requests Without a Library

While the request library is great, it’s not necessary if you want to make HTTP requests
from Node. In this bonus lesson, you’ll learn how to make an HTTP request without
`request`.

The HTTPS Module

Node.js provides two core modules for making HTTP requests. The `http` module can be
used to make `http` requests and the `https` module can be used to make `https` requests.
One great feature about `request` is that it provides a single module that can make both
`http` and `https` requests.

The code below uses the https module to fetch the forecast from the Dark Sky API. Notice
there’s a lot more required to get things working. Separate callbacks are required for
incoming chunks of data, the end of the response, and the error for the request. This
means you’ll likely recreate your own function similar to request to make your life easier.
It’s best to stick with a tested and popular library like `request`.

```js
const https = require("https");
const url =
  "https://api.darksky.net/forecast/9d1465c6f3bb7a6c71944bdd8548d026/40,-75";
const request = https.request(url, (response) => {
  let data = "";
  response.on("data", (chunk) => {
    data = data + chunk.toString();
  });
  response.on("end", () => {
    const body = JSON.parse(data);
    console.log(body);
  });
});
request.on("error", (error) => {
  console.log("An error", error);
});
request.end();
```

## Web Servers

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD024 -->

### Section Intro

We'll be looking into express, as it allows us to easily create a website and let users interact with what we've made.

Node.js is commonly used as a web server to serve up websites, JSON, and more. In this
section, you’ll be creating your first Node server with Express. This will allow users to
interact with your application by visiting a URL in the browser.

---

### Hello Express!

Serving up websites and JSON data is easy with Express. In this lesson, you’ll learn how to
create your first web server with Express. Once the server is up and running, users will be
able to interact with your application via the browser.

To get started, add Express to your project. `npm i express`.

Next, you can require express. You get access to a single function you can call to create a
new Express application.

```js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
```

Now, `app` can be used to set up the server. Let’s start by showing a message when
someone visits the home page at `localhost:3000` and the weather page at
`localhost:3000/weather`.

```js
app.get("", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello express!");
});
app.get("/weather", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Your weather");
});
```

The code above uses `app.get` to set up a handler for an HTTP GET request. The first
argument is the path to set up the handler for. The second argument is the function to run
when that path is visited. Calling `res.send` in the route handler allows you to send back a
message as the response. This will get shown in the browser.

The last thing to do is start the server. This is done by calling `app.listen` with the port you
want to listen on.

This can be done using `app.listen` as shown below.

```js
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server is up on port 3000.");
});
```

If you run the app, you’ll see the message printing letting you know that the server is
running. This process will stay running until you shut it down. You can always use `ctrl + c` to terminate the process. Visit `localhost:3000` or `localhost:3000/weather` to view the
messages!

[Express](https://expressjs.com)

### Serving up HTML and JSON

With the basics out of the way, it’s time to serve up HTML and JSON with Express. That’ll
let you serve up a static website or create an HTTP REST API designed to be consumed
by a web or mobile application.

Serving up HTML and JSON

Using `res.send`, you can send back more than just text. `res.send` can be used to send an
HTML or JSON response. The root route below sends back some HTML to be rendered in
the browser. The weather route below sends back a JSON response.

```js
app.get("", (req, res) => {
  // Provide HTML to render in the browser
  res.send("<h1>Weather</h1>");
});
app.get("/weather", (req, res) => {
  // Provide an object to send as JSON
  res.send({
    forecast: "It is snowing",
    location: "Philadelphia",
  });
});
```

[Express - res.send](http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.send)

---

### Serving up Static Assets

Express can serve up all the assets needed for your website. This includes HTML, CSS,
JavaScript, images, and more. In this lesson, you’ll learn how to serve up an entire
directory with Express.

Serving up a Static Directory

A modern website is more than just an HTML file. It’s styles, scripts, images, and fonts.
Everything needs to be exposed via the web server so the browser can load it in. With
Express, it’s easy to serve up an entire directory without needing to manually serve up
each asset. All Express needs is the path to the directory it should serve.

The example below uses Nodes’ path module to generate the absolute path. The call to
`path.join` allows you to manipulate a path by providing individual path segments. It starts
with `__dirname` which is the directory path for the current script. From there, the second
segment moves out of the `src` folder and into the `public` directory.

The path is then provided to `express.static` as shown below.

```js
const path = require("path");
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const publicDirectoryPath = path.join(__dirname, "../public");
app.use(express.static(publicDirectoryPath));
app.get("/weather", (req, res) => {
  res.send({
    forecast: "It is snowing",
    location: "Philadelphia",
  });
});
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server is up on port 3000.");
});
```

Start the server, and the browser will be able to access all assets in the public directory.

[Node.js path Docs](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v11.x/docs/api/path.html)

---

### Serving up CSS, JS, Images, and More

In this lesson, you’ll use the Express server to serve up a webpage with images, styles,
and scripts.

Serving up CSS, JS, Images, and More

All files in `public` are exposed via the Express server. This is where your site assets need
to live. If they’re not in `public`, then they’re not public and the browser won’t be able to
load them correctly. The HTML file below shows how you can use a CSS file, JavaScript
file, and image in your website.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/styles.css" />
    <script src="/js/app.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>About</h1>
    <img src="/img/me.png" />
  </body>
</html>
```

---

### Dynamic Pages with Templating

Your web pages don’t have to be static. Express supports templating engines that allow
you to render dynamic HTML pages. In this lesson, you’ll learn how to set up the
Handlebars templating engine with Express.

Setting up Handlebars

```cd
npm install hbs
```

From there, you’ll need to use `app.set` to set a value for the `'view engine'` config option.
The value is the name of the template engine module you installed. That’s `'hbs'`.

```js
app.set("view engine", "hbs");
```

Rendering Handlebars Templates

By default, Express expects your views to live in a `views` directory inside of your project
root. You’ll learn how to customize the location and directory name in the next lesson.

Below is an example handlebars view in `views/index.hbs`. This looks like a normal HTML
document with a few new features. Notice `{{title}}` and `{{name}}`. This is a Handlerbars
syntax which allows you to inject variables inside of the template. This is what allows you
to generate dynamic pages.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/styles.css" />
    <script src="/js/app.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>{{title}}</h1>
    <p>Created by {{name}}</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

Now, you can render the template. This is done by defining a new route and calling
`res.render` with the template name. The “.hbs” file extension can be left off. The second
argument is an object that contains all the variables the template should have access to
when rendering. This is where values are provided for `title` and `name`.

```js
app.get("", (req, res) => {
  res.render("index", {
    title: "My title",
    name: "Andrew Mead",
  });
});
```

[Handlebars Documentation](http://handlebarsjs.com/)
[npm: hbs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hbs)

---

### Customizing the Views Directory

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to customize the name and location of the views directory.

Customizing the Views Directory

You can customize the location of the views directory by providing Express with the new
path. Call `app.set` to set a new value for the `'views'` option. The example below
configures Express to look for views in `templates/views/`.

```js
const viewsPath = path.join(__dirname, "../templates/views");
app.set("views", viewsPath);
```

---

### Advanced Templating

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to work with Handlebars partials. As the name suggests,
partials are just part of a web page. Partials are great for things you need to show on
multiple pages like headers, footers, and navigation bars.

Setting up Partials

You can use partials by telling Handlebars where you’d like to store them. This is done
with a call to `hbs.registerPartials`. It expects to get called with the absolute path to the
partials directory.

```js
const hbs = require("hbs");
// Other lines hidden for brevity
const partialsPath = path.join(__dirname, "../templates/partials");
hbs.registerPartials(partialsPath);
// Other lines hidden for brevity
```

Using Partials

Partials are created with the “hbs” file extension. Partials have access to all the same
features as your Handlebars templates. The header partial below renders the title followed
by a list of navigation links which can be shown at the top of every page.

```html
<h1>{{title}}</h1>
<div>
  <a href="/">Weather</a>
  <a href="/about">About</a>
  <a href="/help">Help</a>
</div>
```

The partial can then be rendered on a page using `{{>header}}` where “header” comes
from the partial file name. If the partial was `footer.hbs`, it could be rendered using
`{{>footer}}`

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/styles.css" />
    <script src="/js/app.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    {{>header}}
  </body>
</html>
```

---

### 404 Pages

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to set up a 404 page. The 404 page will show when a user
tries to visit a page that doesn’t exist.

Setting up a 404 Page

Express has support for \* in route paths. This is a special character which matches
anything. This can be used to create a route handler that matches all requests.

The 404 page should be set up just before the call to `app.listen`. This ensures that
requests for valid pages still get the correct response.

```js
app.get("*", (req, res) => {
  res.render("404", {
    title: "404",
    name: "Andrew Mead",
    errorMessage: "Page not found.",
  });
});
```

## Accessing API from Browser (Weather App)

### Section Intro: Accessing API from Browser

This module is going to teach us how to create a HTTP endpoint with Express so that our browser can talk to our server and give a specific string for a forecast and our server can respond to the browser with the forecast data.

---

### The Query String

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to use query strings to pass data from the client to the
server. This will be used to send the address from the browser to Node.js. Node.js will
then be able to fetch the weather for the address and send the forecast back to the
browser.

Working with Query Strings

The query string is a portion of the URL that allows you to provide additional information to
the server. For the weather application, the query string will be used to pass the address
from the browser to the Node.js Express application.

The query string comes after `?` in the URL. The example URL below uses the query string
to set `address` equal to `boston`. The key/value pair is separated by `=`.

```js
http:/localhost:3000/weather?address=boston // + "/" after http:
```

Below is one more example where two key/value pairs are set up. The key/value pairs are
separated by `&`. `address` equals `philadelphia` and `units` equals `us`.

```js
http:/localhost:3000/weather?address=philadelphia&units=us
```

The Express route handler can access the query string key/value pairs on `req.query`. The
handler below uses `req.query.address` to get the value provided for `address`. This
address can then be used to fetch the weather information.

```js
app.get("/weather", (req, res) => {
  // All query string key/value pairs are on req.query
  res.send(`You provided ${req.query.address} as the address`);
});
```

My setup for adding the weather query string is as follows

```js
app.get("/weather", (req, res) => {
  if (!req.query.address) {
    return res.send({
      error: "Must provide a valid address",
    });
  }
  res.send({
    address: req.query.address,
    forecast: "Probably Sunny",
  });
});
```

[Express - req.query](http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#req.query)

---

### Building a JSON HTTP Endpoint

The weather application already has the code in place to fetch the weather for a given
address. In this lesson, it’s your job to wire up the route handler to fetch the weather and
send it back to the browser.

REWATCH THIS VIDEO

```js
app.get("/weather", (req, res) => {
  if (!req.query.address) {
    return res.send({
      error: "Must provide a valid address",
    });
  }
  geocode(req.query.address, (error, { latitude, longitude, location }) => {
    if (error) {
      return res.send({
        error,
      });
    }
    forecast(latitude, longitude, (error, forecastData) => {
      if (error) {
        return res.send({ error });
      }
      res.send({
        forecast: forecastData,
        location,
        address: req.query.address,
      });
    });
  });
});
```

---

### ES6 Aside: Default Function Parameters

ES6 provides a new syntax to set default values for function arguments. In this lesson,
you’ll use this new syntax to improve and clean up the application code.

Default Function Parameters

Function parameters are `undefined` unless an argument value is provided when the
function is called. ES6 now allows function parameters to be configured with a custom
default value.

You can see this in action for the `greeter` function below. `name` will be `'user'` if no value is
provided. `age` will be `undefined` if no value is provided.

```js
const greeter = (name = "user", age) => {
  console.log("Hello " + name);
};
greeter("Andrew"); // Will print: Hello Andrew
greeter(); // Will print: Hello user
```

This syntax can also be used to provide default values when using ES6 destructuring. The
`transaction` function below shows this off by providing a default value for `stock`.

```js
const transaction = (type, { label, stock = 0 } = {}) => {
  console.log(type, label, stock);
};
transaction("order");
```

[MDN: Default Function Parameters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Default_parameters)

---

### Browser HTTP Requests with Fetch

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to make HTTP AJAX requests from the browser. This will
allow the web application to request the forecast from the Node.js server.

The Fetch API

Web APIs provide you with a way to make HTTP requests from JavaScript in the browser.
This is done using the `fetch` function. `fetch` expects to be called with the URL as the first
argument. It sends off the HTTP request and gives you back the response.

The `fetch` call below is used to fetch the weather for Boston. An if statement is then used
to either print the forecast or the error message.

```js
fetch("http://localhost:3000/weather?address=Boston").then((response) => {
  response.json().then((data) => {
    if (data.error) {
      console.log(data.error);
    } else {
      console.log(data.location);
      console.log(data.forecast);
    }
  });
});
```

[Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)
[Fetch Tutorial](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/03/introduction-to-fetch)

---

### Creating a Search Form

In this lesson, you’ll set up the weather search form. This will allow a visitor to type in their
address, click a button, and then see their real-time forecast information.

The Search Form

Below is an example HTML form. It contains a text input and a button which can be used to
submit the form.

```html
<form>
  <input placeholder="Location" />
  <button>Search</button>
</form>
```

Using client-side JavaScript, you can set up an event listener that will allow you to run
some code when the form is submitted. What should that code do? It should grab the
address from the text field, send off an HTTP request to the Node server for the data, and
then render the weather data to the screen.

For the moment, the data is logged to the console. That’ll get fixed in the next lesson.

```js
const weatherForm = document.querySelector("form");
const search = document.querySelector("input");
weatherForm.addEventListener("submit", (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  const location = search.value;
  fetch("http://localhost:3000/weather?address=" + location).then(
    (response) => {
      response.json().then((data) => {
        if (data.error) {
          console.log(data.error);
        } else {
          console.log(data.location);
          console.log(data.forecast);
        }
      });
    }
  );
});
```

---

### Wiring up the User Interface

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to manipulate the text content of HTML elements from
JavaScript. That will allow the weather application to render the forecast data to the
browser instead of the console.

Rendering Dynamic textContent

Set up HTML elements for the messages you want to render. Below is an example
paragraph which can be used to render some text from JavaScript. It contains no text by
default. It will be updated to show some text as the client-side JavaScript runs.

```html
<p id="message-1"></p>
```

The code below can be used to change the text content of the paragraph. First up,
`document.querySelector` is used to target the element. It’s used with #, which searches
for elements by their ID. The text content can be updated by setting a value on the
`textContent` property.

```js
const messageOne = document.querySelector("#message-1");
messageOne.textContent = "My new text";
```

---

## Application Deployment

### Section Intro

In this section, you’ll learn how to deploy your Node.js applications to production. This will
allow anyone with an internet connection to view and interact with your Node.js app.
Along the way, you’ll learn how to use Git, GitHub, Heroku, and more!

---

### Joining Heroku and GitHub

In this lesson, you’ll join GitHub and Heroku. GitHub is a development platform that makes
it easy to manage software development projects. Heroku is an application deployment
platform which provides everything needed to deploy your Node.js applications.

Joining Heroku and GitHub

Make sure to sign up for an account with both GitHub and Heroku. From there, install the
Heroku CLI. After running the installer, you can confirm the Heroku CLI was installed
correctly by running `heroku -v` to print the installed version.

The Heroku CLI gives you commands to deploy and manage your Node.js applications.
Before you can do that, you’ll need to log in to your Heroku account. This makes sure that
the command you run actually changes your Heroku applications.

```cmd
heroku login
```

---

### Version Control with Git

In this lesson, you’ll learn about version control. Version control allows you to track
changes to your project code over time. This makes it easy to recover lost code and
restore your project to a previously working version.

Version Control with Git

Version control lets you track changes to your application code over time. It’s an important
tool, and it should be used for all personal and professional projects.

Imagine you have an application with 250 paying users. You just finished work on a great
new feature and you deploy it to production so your customers can use it. Hours later, you
discover a bug that’s preventing users from using the application. What do you do next?

Without version control, you’re in trouble. The only version of your app is the one you have
on your machine. The buggy application that’s crashing for your users. You have no way of
getting back to the old version of your app that was working. Users are stuck with a
broken application until you can fix the bug and get a new version of the app deployed.

With version control, you’re in the clear. You can revert back to your application’s previous
working state and deploy that. This means that users can continue to use the original
version while you can take a breath and get back to working on that new feature until it’s
ready.

You can grab the Git installer from git-scm.com. After installing Git, run `git --version` to
print the version of Git installed.

[Git](https://git-scm.com)

---

### Exploring Git

Say we're starting a new project and want to include git in our project for version control, first we need to initialize git into our project.

We can think of using git like having 4 columns. Untracked files, unstaged changes, staged changes, and commits.

When we first initialize git our files end up into the untracked files column.

Then, we can stage certain files we want to commit to changes, and then commit them. Once we commit the files they end up in the commits column.

When we make changes to a file that git is already tracking, that goes into the unstaged changes column.

---

### Integrating Git

It’s time to start using Git. In this lesson, you’ll learn how to set up Git in your project. You’ll
also explore the commands needed to get Git tracking your code.

Initializing Git

Git needs to be initialized in your project before it can be used. You can initialize Git in
your project by running `git init` from the root of the project. All Git commands should be
run from the root of the project.

Before going any further, Git needs to be configured to ignore this `node_modules` folder.
This is a generated directory which doesn’t need to be under version control. You can
always regenerate `node_modules` by running `npm install` . Create a `.gitignore` file with
the following line to ignore the folder.

```js
// .gitignore
node_modules/
```

Committing Changes

Think of a commit as a save point. A commit lets you create a save point that contains your
project files exactly as they were when the commit was created. You’ll create new
commits to track your changes as you continue to build out your application.

Before creating a commit, it’s a good idea to run `git status` to get a summary of the
changes that are about to be committed. This will show untracked files, unstaged changes,
and staged files.

Using `git add <path to file>` , you can add files to the staging area. Changes to files in
the staging area will be included in the next commit. The shortcut below adds all
untracked files and unstaged changes to the staging area.

```terminal
git add .
```

You can now use the `git commit` command to create a commit. Each commit requires a
commit message. The command below creates a commit and provides “Initial commit” as
the commit message.

```terminal
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

From here, you can continue to add new features to the project and use the git commands
to create new commits.

---

### Setting up SSH Keys

In this lesson, you’ll be setting up SSH on your machine. SSH is the protocol used to
securely transfer code between your machine and GitHub/Heroku.

Creating SSH Keys

Windows users won’t have access to the necessary SSH commands from the command
prompt. Make sure to use Git Bash for the following commands.

SSH uses an SSH key pair to secure the connection between your machine and the
machine you’re communicating with. You can check if you already have an SSH key pair
with the following command. You have a key pair if you see `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub` in the
output.

```terminal
ls -a -l ~/.ssh
```

You can create a new key pair using the following command. Make sure to swap out the
email for your email address.

```terminal
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "youremail@domain.com"
```

The SSH key needs to be configured to be used for new SSH connections. First, ensure
that the SSH agent is running. You can do that using the command below.

```terminal
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

Next, add the new SSH private key file to the SSH agent. The following command is for
macOS users.

```terminal
ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

The command below is for Linux users and Windows users.

```terminal
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

---

### Pushing Code to GitHub

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to push your code to GitHub.

Configuring SSH with GitHub

In the last lesson, you generated the SSH key pair. The files were `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub`.
`id_rsa` is a private key file which should be kept secret. `id_rsa.pub` is a public key file
which should be shared with the services you plan to communicate with.

The command below will allow you to dump the contents of the public key file to the
terminal. Copy and paste the contents to the clip board and register the SSH key with
GitHub.

```terminal
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Pushing Your Code to GitHub

You need to create a new GitHub repository before you’ll be able to push your code. This
is a remote Git repository that’ll live on the GitHub server. A remote repository is nothing
more than a version of your project hosted somewhere else. In this case, it’s a version of
your project stored on GitHub.

```terminal
git remote add origin <repo url>
```

You can now push your latest commits to the remote! After pushing your commits, refresh
the GitHub repository page in your browser to see your project files and folder appear.

```terminal
git push -u origin master
```

---

### Deploying Node.js to Heroku

In this lesson, you’ll deploy your application to Heroku. Anyone with an internet connection
will be able to access and use your application!

Preparing Your Application

Heroku makes it easy to deploy your application to Node.js, but it does require a few small
changes. First, Heroku needs to know what command to run to start your app. Second,
Heroku requires your app to listen on a specific port.

The `start` script in `package.json` is used to tell Heroku which command to run. Set `start`
equal to `node src/app.js` to ensure that Heroku can start your app up correctly.

Heroku uses an environment variable to provide the port value you need to listen on. The
code below accesses the Heroku port value and uses it to start up the server.

```js
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log("Server is up on port " + port);
});
```

Deploying Your Application

Run `heroku create` from your application root to create a new application. This will create
the new application and set up a new `heroku` Git remote. Push your code to that remote to
deploy the application!

You can run `git push heroku master` to deploy. From there, run `heroku open` to open
your application in the browser.

---

### New Feature Deployment Workflow

In this lesson, you’ll go through the process of adding a new feature to the application.
This includes committing the changes, pushing them to GitHub, and deploying them to
Heroku.

There are no notes for this challenge video, as no new information is covered. The goal is
to give you experience using what was covered in previous lessons.

---

### Avoiding Global Modules

In this lesson, you’ll refactor your application to remove the use of global modules. This
ensures that your application installs all the dependencies you need to run.

Replacing Global Modules with Local Modules

Sick of typing out that long nodemon command? Me too. Let’s turn it into a script.

You can create a `dev` script with the value `nodemon src/app.js -e js,hbs`. This will start
up the `dev` server anytime you run `npm run dev`.

The `dev` script needs `nodemon` to be installed. The issue is that `nodemon` isn’t listed as a
dependency in `package.json`. However, this can be fixed by uninstalling `nodemon`
globally.

```terminal
npm uninstall -g nodemon
```

Now, install it as a local dependency.

```terminal
npm install nodemon --save-dev
```

Now, `npm install` will be able to install all your application dependencies, including
`nodemon`!

---

### MongoDB and Promises (Task App)

### Section Intro: Databases and Advanced Asynchronous Development

In this section, you’ll learn how to connect to a MongoDB database from your Node.js
application. This will allow your application to store data in a secure and reliable fashion.
The task application will use MongoDB to store user accounts as well as tasks.

---

### MongoDB and NoSQL Databases

In this lesson, you’ll explore NoSQL databases and MongoDB. MongoDB and NoSQL
database are a bit different than traditional SQL databases such as MySQL, so this lesson
will bring you up to speed on some key ideas and terminologies related to NoSQL.

Look at the attached image for more information.

[SQL vs NoSQL](/img/tcndc-am/tcndc-am1.png)

### Installing MongoDB on macOS and Linux

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to install MongoDB on macOS and Linux. Using Windows?
That’s covered in the next lesson.

You can download the MongoDB Community Server from the MongoDB download page.
The download is a zip file. Unzip the contents, change the folder name to “mongodb”, and
move it to your users home directory. From there, create a “mongodb-data” directory in
your user directory to store the database data.

You can start the server using the following command. Make sure to swap out
“/Users/Andrew/” with the correct path to your users home directory.

```terminal
/Users/Andrew/mongodb/bin/mongod --dbpath=/Users/Andrew/mongodb-data
```

[MongoDB Download Page](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community)

### Installing MongoDB on Windows

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to install MongoDB on Windows. Using macOS or Linux?
They were covered in the previous lesson.

You can download the MongoDB Community Server from the MongoDB download page.
The download is a zip file. Unzip the contents, change the folder name to “mongodb”, and
move it to your users home directory. From there, create a “mongodb-data” directory in
your user directory to store the database data.

You can start the server using the following command. Make sure to swap out
“/Users/Andrew/” with the correct path to your users home directory.

```terminal
/Users/Andrew/mongodb/bin/mongod --dbpath=/Users/Andrew/mongodb-data
```

### Installing Database GUI Viewer

In this lesson, you’ll set up Robo 3T. Robo 3T is a MongoDB admin tool that makes it easy
to manage and visualize the data in your database.

Robo 3T is a completely free MongoDB admin tool. Grab the installer from here and get it
installed on your machine.

[Robo 3T Download Page](https://robomongo.org/)

### Connecting and Inserting Documents

In this lesson, you’ll be connecting to your MongoDB database from your Node.js
application. You’ll also learn how to insert documents into the database to save them for
later.

Connecting to MongoDB

MongoDB provides a native driver that allows you to connect to your database from Node.
You can grab the driver by installing the mongodb npm module as shown below.

```terminal
npm i mongodb@3.1.10
```

With the driver installed, you can use the following code to connect to the database. You
just need to provide two pieces of information. The first is the connection URL and the
second is the name of the database. You can pick any database name that you like.

```js
const mongodb = require('mongodb')
const MongoClient = mongodb.MongoClient
const connectionURL = 'mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017'
const databaseName = 'task-manager'
MongoClient.connect(connectionURL, { useNewUrlParser: true }, (error, client)
=> {
if (error) {
return console.log('Unable to connect to database!')
}
const db = client.db(databaseName)
// Start to interact with the database
})
```

Inserting a Document

With the connection open, you’re ready to insert documents into the database. Remember
that a database is made up of collections, and collections are used to store documents.
The code below inserts a new document into the “users” collection. `db.collection` is used to get a reference to the collection you’re trying to manipulate. `insertOne` is used to insert a new document into that collection.

```js
db.collection("users").insertOne({
  name: "Andrew",
  age: 27,
});
```

[NPM MongoDB](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb)
[MongoDB Driver](http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.1/api/)

---

### Inserting Documents

In this lesson, you’ll explore another way to insert documents into collections.

Inserting Documents

You already know that `insertOne` can be used to insert a single document. You can also
use `insertMany` to insert multiple documents at once. The example below inserts two
documents into “tasks” collection. `insertMany` expects an array of objects, an array of the
documents you want to insert.

```js
db.collection("tasks").insertMany(
  [
    {
      description: "Clean the house",
      completed: true,
    },
    {
      description: "Renew inspection",
      completed: false,
    },
  ],
  (error, result) => {
    if (error) {
      return console.log("Unable to insert tasks!");
    }
    console.log(result.ops);
  }
);
```

[insertOne Docs](http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.1/api/Collection.html#insertOne)

---

### The ObjectID

In this lesson, you’ll learn about ObjectIDs. MongoDB uses ObjectIDs to create unique
identifiers for all the documents in the database. It’s different than the traditional auto-
incrementing integer ID, but it comes with its own set of advantages.

Working with ObjectIDs

MongoDB provides `ObjectID` which can be used to generate new ObjectIDs. The
example below generates a new ID and prints it to the console.

```js
const { MongoClient, ObjectID } = require("mongodb");
const id = new ObjectID();
console.log(id); // Print new id to the console
```

An ObjectID is a GUID (Globally Unique Identifier). GUIDs are generated randomly via an
algorithm to ensure uniqueness. These IDs can be generated on the server, but as seen in
the snippet above, they can be generated on the client as well. That means a client can
generate the ID for a document it’s about to insert in to the database.

---

### Querying Documents

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to read data from MongoDB. This will allow you to fetch the
documents that you had previously inserted.

Finding Documents

You can search for documents in a given collection using `find` or `findOne`. `find` can be
used to fetch multiple documents, while `findOne` can be used to fetch a single document.

The example below uses `find` to search for documents in the tasks collection. You can
provide an object as the first argument to `find` to filter the documents. The example below
sets `completed` equal to `false` to fetch only those tasks that haven’t been completed.

```js
db.collection("tasks")
  .find({ completed: false })
  .toArray((error, tasks) => {
    console.log(tasks);
  });
```

The next example uses `findOne` to find a single document by its ID. In this case, it’s
necessary to pass the string version of the ID to the `ObjectID` constructor function to
convert it to an `ObjectID`.

```js
db.collection("tasks").findOne(
  { _id: new ObjectID("5c0fec243ef6bdfbe1d62e2f") },
  (error, task) => {
    console.log(task);
  }
);
```

[findOne Docs](http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.1/api/Collection.html#findOne)

---

### Promises

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to work with promises. Promises provide a much needed
alternative to the traditional callback pattern.

```js
const doWorkPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve([7, 4, 1]);
    // reject('Things went wrong!')
  }, 2000);
});

doWorkPromise
  .then((result) => {
    console.log("Success!", result);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log("Error!", error);
  });
```

---

### Updating Documents

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to update documents stored in MongoDB.

Updating Documents

You can update documents in a collection using `updateOne` or `updateMany`. The first
argument for both `updateOne` and `updateMany` is similar to the first argument used with
`find` or `findOne`. It’s an object that allows you to filter down all the documents to just the
ones you want to update.

The update calls require a second argument as well. This is an object where you define
the updates you want to make. For this, you need to use one of the supported [update operators](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/update/#id1).

The `updateOne` call below uses `$inc` to increment the `age` field on the targeted document
by 1.

```js
db.collection("users")
  .updateOne(
    {
      _id: new ObjectID("5c0fe6634362c1fb75b9d6b5"),
    },
    {
      $inc: {
        age: 1,
      },
    }
  )
  .then((result) => {
    console.log(result);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log(error);
  });
```

The `updateMany` call below uses `$set` to set the completed field to `true` for all documents
where the `completed` field is currently `false`.

```js
db.collection("tasks")
  .updateMany({ completed: false }, { $set: { completed: true } })
  .then((success) => {
    console.log(success);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log(error);
  });
```

[Update operators](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/update/#id1)

---

### Deleting Documents

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to delete documents stored in MongoDB.

Deleting Documents

You can delete documents from MongoDB using `deleteOne` or `deleteMany`. Both accept
an object as the first argument. This object is used to filter just the documents you want to
delete.

The example below uses `deleteMany` to delete all `users` whose `age` field is `27`.

```js
db.collection("users")
  .deleteMany({
    age: 27,
  })
  .then((result) => {
    console.log(result);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log(error);
  });
```

This next example uses `deleteOne` to delete a single document, the first one with a
description of `"Clean the house"`.

```js
db.collection("tasks")
  .deleteOne({
    description: "Clean the house",
  })
  .then((result) => {
    console.log(result);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log(error);
  });
```

## REST APIs and Mongoose

### Section Intro: REST APIs and Mongoose

In this section, you’ll be creating a REST API using Express. You’ll learn what exactly a
REST API is and how it can be used as the back-end for a web or mobile application. This
section also covers data validation, application architecture, async/await, and more.

---

### Setting up Mongoose

In this lesson, you’ll be setting up Mongoose. Mongoose makes it easy to model and
manage your application data. This includes data sanitization, data validation, and more.
Mongoose will serve as a replacement for the native driver, providing you with a more
object-oriented interface.

Setting up Mongoose

First up, install Mongoose.

```bash
npm i mongoose
```

Like the MongoDB native driver, Mongoose provides a `connect` function you can use to
connect to your MongoDB database.

```js
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
mongoose.connect("mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/task-manager-api", {
  useNewUrlParser: true,
  useCreateIndex: true,
});
```

Modeling Your Data

The core feature of Mongoose is the ability to model your data. A new model can be
created for the different types of data your application needs to store. You can create as
many models as your application needs.

The code below defines a user model. The model definition is where you define what
makes up a user. This would include all the pieces of data you want to store in the
database. The user model below has just two fields, a name and an age.

```js
const User = mongoose.model("User", {
  name: {
    type: String,
  },
  age: {
    type: Number,
  },
});
```

With the model defined, it’s time to start creating and saving users. The `User` variable
above stores the Mongoose model. This is a constructor function that can be used to
create new users. The snippet below creates a new user with the name `'Andrew'` and the
age `27`. This alone won’t save any data to the database, but it’s a step in the right direction.

```js
const me = new User({
  name: "Andrew",
  age: 27,
});
```

The new model instance can be saved to the database using the save method.

```js
me.save()
  .then((success) => {
    console.log(success);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log("Error!", error);
  });
```

[Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)

---

### Creating a Mongoose Model

In this lesson, it’s on you to define a second Mongoose model for tasks.

```js
const Task = mongoose.model("Task", {
  description: {
    type: String,
  },
  completed: {
    type: Boolean,
  },
});

const task1 = new Task({
  description: "Complete MongoDB University",
  completed: false,
});

task1
  .save()
  .then((success) => {
    console.log(success);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log(error);
  });
```

If we open Robo 3T to view our data, we will notice that it created a new collection called `"tasks"`, even though we didn't write this collection name anywhere. It gets this name from our `mongoose.model` where we define what our model should be called. It takes the name and makes it lowercase as well as pluralizes it.

---

### Data Validation and Sanitization: Part 1

In this lesson, you’ll set up data validation and sanitization for your models. Validation will
allow you to restrict what data can be stored in the database, while sanitization will allow
you to store user data in a uniform and standardized way.

Data Validation and Sanitization

First up, install validator. While Mongoose provides basic tools for performing validation,
the validator library provides useful methods for validating data such as email addresses,
phone numbers, zip codes, and more.

```bash
npm i validator
```

Mongoose comes with support for basic validation and sanitization. The user model below
shows how this can be configured. `required` is used to validate that a value is provided for
a given field. `trim` is used to remove extra spaces before or after data. `lowercase` is used
to convert the data to lowercase before saving it to the database. You can find a complete
list of options in the [schema documentation](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/schematypes.html).

You can also define custom validation for your models. This is done using `validate` as
shown in the example below. The method gets called with the value to validate, and it
should throw an error if the data is invalid. The example below uses the `isEmail` method
from validator to validate the email address is valid before saving it to the database.

```js
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
const validator = require("validator");

const User = mongoose.model("User", {
  name: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    trim: true,
  },
  email: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    trim: true,
    lowercase: true,
    validate(value) {
      if (!validator.isEmail(value)) {
        throw new Error("Email is invalid");
      }
    },
  },
});
```

[npm Validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/validator)

---

### Data Validation and Sanitization: Part 2

Our challenge for this video was to add more data validation and sanitization to our task and user collections.
Below is the custom password validation schema we set up.

```js
  password: {
    required: true,
    type: String,
    minlength: 7,
    trim: true,
    validate(value) {
      if (value.toLowerCase().includes("password")) {
        throw new Error(`Password cannot be "password"`);
      }
    },
  },
```

---

### Structuring a REST API

What exactly is a REST API?

- Representational State Transfer - Application Programming Interface (REST API of RESTful API)

We are going to use various HTTP methods to interact with the database.

- Create: `POST /tasks`
- Read: `GET /tasks`
- Read: `GET /tasks/:id`
- Update: `PATCH /tasks/:id`
- Delete: `DELETE /tasks/:id`

---

### Installing Postman

In this lesson, you’ll set up Postman. Postman makes it easy to test your REST API by
providing you with a set of tools for making HTTP requests. This is not meant to serve as a replacement for a web or mobile application, it’s just a useful way to debug your endpoints as you’re creating them.

You can grab Postman [here](https://www.getpostman.com/). It’s free and available for all operating systems.

---

### Resource Creation Endpoints: Part 1

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to create REST API endpoints for creating resources. This
will allow users of the API to create new users and new tasks.

Resource Creation Endpoints

Resource creation endpoints use the POST HTTP method. The URL structure is
`/resources`. If you wanted to create a user, it would be `POST /users`. If you wanted to
create a task, it would be `POST /tasks`.

The code below uses `app.post` to set up a `POST` request handler for `/users`. The handler
function creates a new instance of the user model and saves it to the database.

`express.json` is also setup to parse incoming JSON into a JavaScript object which you
can access on `req.body`.

```js
app.use(express.json());
app.post("/users", (req, res) => {
  const user = new User(req.body);
  user
    .save()
    .then(() => {
      res.send(user);
    })
    .catch((e) => {
      res.status(400).send(e);
    });
});
```

---

### Resource Creation Endpoints: Part 2

In this video, our task was to set up a resource creation endpoint for creating tasks.
We set up a model for our Mongoose validation which looked like this:

```js
const mongoose = require("mongoose");

const Task = mongoose.model("Task", {
  description: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    trim: true,
  },
  completed: {
    type: Boolean,
    default: false,
  },
});

module.exports = Task;
```

From there, we set up a route on Express to listen and add the body data to our database if it's valid.

```js
app.post("/tasks", (req, res) => {
  const task = new Task(req.body);

  task
    .save()
    .then(() => {
      res.send(task);
    })
    .catch((e) => {
      res.status(400).send(e);
    });
});
```

---

### Resource Reading Endpoints: Part 1

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to create REST API endpoints for reading resources. This
will allow users of the API to fetch users and tasks from the database.

Resource Reading Endpoints

Resource reading endpoints use the GET HTTP method. The URL structure is `/resources`
for a list of resources and `/resources/:id` for fetching an individual resource by its ID. If
you wanted to fetch all your tasks, it would be `GET /tasks`. If you wanted to fetch an
individual task with the ID of 198, it would be `GET /tasks/198`.

The code below uses `app.get` to set up a GET request handler for `/users/:id`. `:id` serves
as a placeholder for the ID of the user to fetch. If the request is `GET /users/321`, then the
ID will be 321. This is known as a URL parameter, and you can access the value for URL
parameters on `req.params`.

```js
app.get("/users/:id", (req, res) => {
  const _id = req.params.id; // Access the id provided
  User.findById(_id)
    .then((user) => {
      if (!user) {
        return res.status(404).send();
      }
      res.send(user);
    })
    .catch((e) => {
      res.status(500).send();
    });
});
```

[Express Route Parameters](http://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html#route-parameters)

---

### Resource Reading Endpoints: Part 2

In this video, our challenge was to create an endpoint that will return either all the tasks or if we have an id specified then we return the task with the matching id.

```js
// Fetch all tasks
app.get("/tasks", (req, res) => {
  Task.find({})
    .then((tasks) => {
      res.send(tasks);
    })
    .catch((e) => {
      res.status(500).send(e);
    });
});

// Fetch task by id
app.get("/tasks/:id", (req, res) => {
  const _id = req.params.id;
  Task.findById(_id)
    .then((task) => {
      if (!task) res.status(404).send();
      res.send(task);
    })
    .catch((e) => {
      res.status(500).send(e);
    });
});
```

---

### Promise Chaining

In this lesson, you’ll explore promise chaining. Promise chaining is a syntax that allows you
to chain together multiple asynchronous tasks in a specific order. This is great for complex
code where one asynchronous task needs to be performed after the completion of a
different asynchronous task.

Promise Chaining

To demonstrate promise chaining, the following function will be used to simulate an
asynchronous task. In reality, it’s just adding up a couple of numbers, waiting two seconds,
and fulfilling the promise with the sum.

```js
const add = (a, b) => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      if (a < 0 || b < 0) {
        return reject("Numbers must be non-negative");
      }
      resolve(a + b);
    }, 2000);
  });
};
```

With the dummy asynchronous function defined, promise chaining can be used to call `add`
twice. The code below adds up `1` and `2` for a total of `3`. It then uses the sum of `3` as the
input for another call to `add`. The second call to add adds up `3` and `4` for a total of `7`.

Promise chaining occurs when the `then` callback function returns a promise. This allows
you to chain on another `then` call which will run when the second promise is fulfilled. `catch`
can still be called to handle any errors that might occur along the way.

```js
add(1, 2)
  .then((sum) => {
    console.log(sum); // Will print 3
    return add(sum, 4);
  })
  .then((sum2) => {
    console.log(sum2); // Will print 7
  })
  .catch((e) => {
    console.log(e);
  });
```

---

### Promise Chaining Challenge

To use promise chaining, we return new promises in our current `.then` call.

```js
require("../src/db/mongoose"); // DB Connection
const Task = require("../src/models/task");

Task.findByIdAndDelete(`5ee7cb9625e4f551013c541f`)
  .then((response) => {
    console.log(response);
    return Task.countDocuments();
  })
  .then((result) => {
    console.log(result);
    return Task.estimatedDocumentCount();
  })
  .then((docCount) => {
    console.log(docCount);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log(error);
  });
```

---

### Async/Await

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to use async and await. These provide an improved syntax
for working with promises. You’ll be able to write complex asynchronous code that looks
like normal synchronous code. This makes it much easier to write and maintain
asynchronous code.

Exploring Async/Await

The example below uses the `add` function that was created two lessons ago.

The first step to using async and await is to create an asynchronous function. This is done
using the `async` keyword before the function definition. This can be seen in the definition
of `doWork` below. Any function can be defined as an asynchronous function, not just arrow
functions.

With an async function in place, you can now use the `await` operator. The `await` operator
can only be used inside of asynchronous functions. This removes the need for excess
callbacks and makes code much easier to read.

The `await` operator is used with promises in asynchronous functions. You can see this
used three times in `doWork`. The `await` operator allows you to work with promises in a way
that looks like synchronous code. If the promise is fulfilled, the fulfilled value can be
accessed as the return value from the function. If the promise is rejected, it would be as
though the function threw an error. `await` will pause the function execution until the
promise is either fulfilled or rejected.

It’s important to note that async and await are syntax enhancements for working with
promises. Promises are still at the core of asynchronous code that uses async and await.

```js
const add = (a, b) => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      if (a < 0 || b < 0) return reject(`Numbers must be non-negative`);
      resolve(a + b);
    }, 2000);
  });
};

const doWork = async () => {
  const sum = await add(1, 99);
  const sum2 = await add(sum, 50);
  const sum3 = await add(sum2, 3);
  return sum3;
};

doWork()
  .then((result) => {
    console.log(result);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log(error);
  });
```

[MDN: async function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function)
[MDN: await operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await)

---

### Async/Await: Part 2

In this lesson, we refactored our previous promise chaining call to delete a Task by its id by using async functions.

```js
const deleteTaskAndCount = async (id) => {
  const task = await Task.findByIdAndDelete(id);
  const count = await Task.countDocuments({ completed: false });
  return count;
};

deleteTaskAndCount(`5ed811ff69a4895dea309862`)
  .then((count) => {
    console.log(count);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log(error);
  });
```

---

### Integrating Async/Await

In this lesson, you’ll be integrating async and await into the Express route handlers.

Integrating Async/Await

Below is a modified version of `GET /users`. The handler function was set up as an
asynchronous function which allows you to use await in the function. `await` is used with
the promise from `User.find` to get a list of all the users without needing to call `then` and
`catch` with handler functions. A try/catch statement is also used to handle any errors that
might occur.

```js
app.get("/users", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const users = await User.find({});
    res.send(users);
  } catch (e) {
    res.status(500).send();
  }
});
```

---

### Resource Updating Endpoints: Part 1

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to create REST API endpoints for updating resources. This
will allow users of the API to update users and tasks that are already in the database.

Resource Updating Endpoints

Resource updating endpoints use the PATCH HTTP method. The URL structure is
`/resources/:id` for updating an individual resource by its ID. If you want to update an
individual task with the ID of 44, it would be `PATCH /tasks/44`.

`app.patch` is used to set up the Express route handler.

```js
app.patch("/users/:id", async (req, res) => {
  // Route handler code here
});
```

When working with updates, it’s a good idea to alert the user if they’re trying to update
something that they can’t update. The code below checks that the user is only updating
fields that can be updated, otherwise it will send back an error response.

```js
const updates = Object.keys(req.body);
const allowedUpdates = ["name", "email", "password", "age"];
const isValidOperation = updates.every((update) =>
  allowedUpdates.includes(update)
);
if (!isValidOperation) {
  return res.status(400).send({ error: "Invalid updates!" });
}
```

If all goes well, the updates will be applied to the user, then a response will be sent back.

If the provided updates are valid, `findByIdAndUpdate` can be used to update the
document in the database. Try/catch is used here to send back an error if something goes
wrong when updating the user. This would include the new data not passing the validation
defined for the model.

```js
try {
  const user = await User.findByIdAndUpdate(req.params.id, req.body, {
    new: true,
    runValidators: true,
  });
  if (!user) {
    return res.status(404).send();
  }
  res.send(user);
} catch (e) {
  res.status(400).send(e);
}
```

---

### Resource Creating Endpoints: Part 2

In this video our task was to create a patch endpoint that could be used to update tasks.

```js
// Update task
app.patch("/tasks/:id", async (req, res) => {
  const updates = Object.keys(req.body);
  const allowedUpdates = ["description", "completed"];
  const isValidOperation = updates.every((update) => {
    return allowedUpdates.includes(update);
  });

  if (!isValidOperation) {
    return res.status(400).send({ error: "Invalid updates!" });
  }

  try {
    const task = await Task.findByIdAndUpdate(req.params.id, req.body, {
      new: true,
      runValidators: true,
    });
    if (!task) {
      return res.status(404).send();
    }
    res.send(task);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(400).send(error);
  }
});
```

---

### Resource Deleting Endpoints

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to set up a REST API endpoint for deleting resources. This
video covers deleting users as well as a challenge for deleting tasks.

Deleting Resources

Resource deleting endpoints use the DELETE HTTP method. The URL structure is
`/resources/:id` for deleting an individual resource by its ID. If you want to delete an
individual task with the ID of 897, it would be `DELETE /tasks/897`.

`app.delete` is used to set up the Express route handler.

```js
app.delete("/users/:id", async (req, res) => {
  // Route handler
});
```

The handler itself can delete the resource using `findByIdAndDelete`.

```js
try {
  const user = await User.findByIdAndDelete(req.params.id);
  if (!user) {
    return res.status(404).send();
  }
  res.send(user);
} catch (e) {
  res.status(500).send();
}
```

---

### Separate Route Files

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to organize your Express application endpoints. Defining all
endpoints in a single file is a fine way to get started, but that won’t scale well as you add
more routes to the app.

Creating Separate Routers

Express allows you to create as many routers as you want. These separate routers can
then be combined into a single Express application. You can create a new router using
`express.Router` as shown below. The example file below creates the router, adds routes,
and exports the router from the file.

```js
const router = new express.Router();
router.post("/someEndpoint", (req, res) => {
  // Do something
});
module.exports = router;
```

The router defined in the file above can be added into the Express application in
`index.js`. This is done by loading the router in with `require` and then passing the router to `app.use`.
You can set up as many routers as you need for your application, though it’s
common to have a router for each distinct resource your REST API has.

```js
// Register with existing application
app.use(router);
```

---

## API Authentication and Security

### Section Intro

In this section, you’ll set up authentication for the task manager app. This will require users
to log in before they’ll be able to manage their tasks. This section also covers password
security, Express middleware, and more.

---

### Securely Storing Passwords: Part 1

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to securely store user passwords by hashing and salting the
password before storing it in the database.

Hashing Passwords

Storing plain text passwords is a bad idea. Most folks reuse password for multiple
accounts online. That means if your database gets compromised, the hacker can reuse
those credentials on other sites such as credit cards or bank accounts. We don’t want to
leave our users open to further attacks.

The solution is to hash passwords using a secure one-way hashing algorithm. Users
passwords will stay hidden and secure, even if the database is compromised.

Hashing Passwords with Bcrypt

First up, install the library. `npm i bcryptjs@2.4.3`.

The `hash` method can be used to hash the plain text password. The example below
hashes the password “Red12345!”.

```js
const password = "Red12345!";
const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, 8);
// The hashed password is what would be stored in the database
```

The `compare` method is used to compare a plain text password against a previously
hashed password. This would be useful when logging in. The user logging in provides the
plain text password for their account. The application fetches the hashed password from
the database for that user. `compare` is then called to confirm it’s a match.

```js
const isMatch = await bcrypt.compare("red12345!", hashedPassword);
console.log(isMatch);
```

[NPM bcryptjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcryptjs)

---

### Securely Storing Passwords: Part 2

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to use Mongoose middleware. Middleware will allow you to
automatically hash a user’s password before the user is saved to the database.

Mongoose Middleware

Middleware allows you to register some code to run before or after a lifecycle event for
your model. As an example, you could use middleware to register some code to run just
after a user is deleted. You could also use middleware to register some code to run just
before the user is saved. This can be used to hash passwords just before saving users to
the database.

The example below calls `pre` with the `'save'` lifecycle event. This registers a function to
run just before users are saved. The function itself checks if the password has been
altered. If the password has been altered, the plain text password is overwritten with a
hashed version.

```js
userSchema.pre("save", async function (next) {
  const user = this;
  if (user.isModified("password")) {
    user.password = await bcrypt.hash(user.password, 8);
  }
  next();
});
```

[Mongoose Middleware](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/middleware.html)

---

### Logging in Users

In this lesson, you’ll set up the ability for users to log into their existing accounts.

Logging in Users

Logging in a user is a two-step process. The user provides their email and password, and
the first thing to do is fetch the user by their email. From there, bcrypt is used to verify the
password provided matches the hashed password stored in the database. If either step
fails, the users won’t be able to log in. If both steps succeed, then you know the user is
who they say they are.

The code below sets up findByCredentials which finds a user by their email and
password.

```js
userSchema.statics.findByCredentials = async (email, password) => {
  const user = await User.findOne({ email });
  if (!user) {
    throw new Error("Unable to login");
  }
  const isMatch = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.password);
  if (!isMatch) {
    throw new Error("Unable to login");
  }
  return user;
};
```

You can then call `findByCredentials` from you application when users need to login. The
example below shows how this can be done.

```js
const user = await User.findByCredentials(req.body.email, req.body.password);
```

---

### JSON Web Tokens

In this lesson, you’ll explore JWTs (JSON Web Tokens). JWTs provide a nice system for
issuing and validating authentication tokens. The authentication token will ensure that the
client doesn’t need to log in every time they want to perform an operation on the server.

JSON Web Tokens

First up, install the library.

`npm i jsonwebtoken@8.4.0`

The `sign` method can be used to generate a new token. `sign` accepts three arguments:

The first is the data to embed in the token: This needs to include a unique identifier for the
user.

The second is a secret phrase: This is used to issue and validate tokens, ensuring that the
token data hasn’t been tampered with.

The third is a set of options: The example below uses `expiresIn` to create a token that’s
valid for seven days.

```js
const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken");
const token = jwt.sign({ _id: "abc123" }, "thisismynewcourse", {
  expiresIn: "7 days",
});
```

Tokens can be issued to users when they sign up or log in to the application. These can
then be stored on the data and used to authenticate the user when they perform other
options.

The server can verify the token using `verify`. This requires two arguments:

The first is the token to validate.

The second is the secret phrase that the token was created with. If valid, the embedded
data will be returned. This would allow the server to figure out which user is performing
the operation.

```js
const data = jwt.verify(token, "thisismynewcourse");
// data._id contains the user id of the user that owns this token
```

---

### Generating Authentication Tokens

In this lesson, you’ll integrate JWTs into the application. This will allow the app to issue an
authentication token when a user signs up or logs in.

Generating and Storing Auth Tokens

Authentication tokens for a user can be stored in the database. This provides a way for
users to log out. All generated authentication tokens will be stored as part of the user
profile. If a user logs out, that token will be removed from the user profile. A token would
only be considered valid if it’s a valid JWT and it’s still stored as part of the user profile. A
user could be logged out of all session by simply deleting all the tokens stored in their
user profile.

The snippet below adds a `tokens` array onto the user model. This will be used to store all
valid authentication tokens for a user.

```js
// Other properties and options omitted for brevity
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  tokens: [
    {
      token: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

The instance method below is responsible for generating new authentication tokens. The
token is created, stored in the database, and finally returned from the function.

```js
userSchema.methods.generateAuthToken = async function () {
  const user = this;
  const token = jwt.sign({ _id: user._id.toString() }, "thisismynewcourse");
  user.tokens = user.tokens.concat({ token });
  await user.save();
  return token;
};
```

`generateAuthToken` can then be called to generate a fresh authentication token when
users sign up or log in.

```js
const token = await user.generateAuthToken();
```

### Express Middleware

In this lesson, you’ll explore Express middleware. When working with middleware, you’ll
have more control over how your server processes requests. This will be used to check
that a user is authenticated before performing specific operations.

Exploring Express Middleware

Express middleware is nothing more than a function that runs as Express handles a given
request. You can customize the function to do whatever you want it to do, and you can
have it run whenever you want it to.

The example below uses middleware to print information about incoming requests.
Middleware functions should accept three parameters: `req`, `res`, and `next`. The only new
parameter is `next`. `next` is called to signal to Express that the middleware function is done.

```js
const loggerMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log("New request to: " + req.method + " " + req.path);
  next();
};
// Register the function as middleware for the application
app.use(loggerMiddleware);
```

[Express Middleware](http://expressjs.com/th/guide/using-middleware.html)

---

### Accepting Authentication Tokens

In this lesson, you’ll use Express middleware to put specific routes behind authentication.
That will require the client to be authenticated before the operation can be performed

Accepting and Validating Tokens

The goal of the authentication middleware is to validate the authentication token and then
fetch the profile for that user. `auth` below shows how you can get this done. Notice that
the user profile is added onto `req.user`. This allows route handler functions to access the
user profile without needing to fetch it again.

```js
const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken");
const User = require("../models/user");
const auth = async (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    const token = req.header("Authorization").replace("Bearer ", "");
    const decoded = jwt.verify(token, "thisismynewcourse");
    const user = await User.findOne({
      _id: decoded._id,
      "tokens.token": token,
    });
    if (!user) {
      throw new Error();
    }
    req.user = user;
    next();
  } catch (e) {
    res.status(401).send({ error: "Please authenticate." });
  }
};
module.exports = auth;
```

The authentication middleware can be added to individual endpoints to lock them down.
This is shown with `GET /users/me below`. `auth` is added as the second argument to
`router.get`, meaning that it will run before the route handler function runs. This will ensure
the user is authenticated.

```js
router.get("/users/me", auth, async (req, res) => {
  res.send(req.user);
});
```

---

### Advanced Postman

In this lesson, you’ll explore Postman environments. Environments make it easy to manage
your requests and authentication without having to manually add authentication tokens to
the individual requests.

There are no notes for this video. Refer to the video to learn how to set up Postman
environments.

---

### Logging Out

In this lesson, it was our task to log out the user. When we log out the user we are removing the token that they used to sign in from their account. As a challenge, we also set up a route that would delete all of the tokens the user has generated. This can be helpful if the user wants to log out of all the devices that they're signed in on.

```js
// Logout user
router.post("/users/logout", auth, async (req, res) => {
  try {
    req.user.tokens = req.user.tokens.filter((token) => {
      return token.token !== req.token;
    });
    await req.user.save();
    res.send();
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).send();
  }
});

// Logout of all user sessions
router.post("/users/logoutAll", auth, async (req, res) => {
  try {
    req.user.tokens = [];
    await req.user.save();
    res.send(200);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).send();
  }
});
```

---

### Hiding Private Data

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to limit what data gets sent to the client. This will allow you
to hide authentication tokens and hashed passwords from server responses.

Hiding Private Data

When a Mongoose document is passed to `res.send`, Mongoose converts the object into
JSON. You can customize this by adding `toJSON` as a method on the object. The method
below removes the `password` and `tokens` properties before sending the response back.

```js
userSchema.methods.toJSON = function () {
  const user = this;
  const userObject = user.toObject();
  delete userObject.password;
  delete userObject.tokens;
  return userObject;
};
```

---

### Authenticating User Endpoints

In this lesson, you’ll be adding authentication to the other user endpoints.

There are no notes for this challenge video, as no new information is covered. The goal is
to give you experience using what was covered in previous lessons.

---

### The User/Task Relationship

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to create a relationship between a user and tasks. This will
make it possible to know which tasks a user created.

Mongoose Relationships

To set up the relationship, both the user and task model will be changed. First up, a new
field needs to be added onto the task. This will store the ID of the user who created it.

```js
// Other properties and options omitted for brevity
const Task = mongoose.model("Task", {
  owner: {
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    required: true,
    ref: "User",
  },
});
```

Next, a virtual property needs to be added onto the user. The code below adds a `tasks`
field onto users that can be used to fetch the tasks for a given user. It’s a virtual property
because users in the database won’t have a `tasks` field. It’s a reference to the task data
stored in the separate collection.

```js
userSchema.virtual("tasks", {
  ref: "Task",
  localField: "_id",
  foreignField: "owner",
});
```

With the relationship configured, tasks can be created with an `owner` value.

The code below shows how you can fetch the owner of a given task.

```js
const task = await Task.findById("5c2e505a3253e18a43e612e6");
await task.populate("owner").execPopulate();
console.log(task.owner);
```

The code below shows how you can fetch the tasks for a given user.

```js
const user = await User.findById("5c2e4dcb5eac678a23725b5b");
await user.populate("tasks").execPopulate();
console.log(user.tasks);
```

---

### Authenticating Task Endpoints

In this lesson, you’ll be setting up authentication for the other task endpoints.

There are no notes for this challenge video, as no new information is covered. The goal is
to give you experience using what was covered in previous lessons.

---

### Cascade Delete Tasks

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to use Mongoose middleware to clean up a user’s tasks
when they close their account. This will make sure that all their data is securely removed
from the database.

Deleting a User’s Tasks

The middleware function below is registered using `pre`. It will run just before `remove` fires
for the user. The function itself deletes all tasks created by that user. Now when a user
closes their account, their other data will get deleted too.

```js
const Task = require("./task");
// Existing code omitted for brevity
userSchema.pre("remove", async function (next) {
  const user = this;
  await Task.deleteMany({ owner: user._id });
  next();
});
```

## Sorting, Pagination, and Filtering

### Section Intro: Sorting, Pagination, and Filtering

In this section, you’ll explore advanced techniques for fetching data. This includes sorting,
filtering, and pagination. All three of these will give clients more control over what data
they get back. This keeps applications fast, as they don’t need to fetch unnecessary data

---

### Working with Timestamps

In this lesson, you’ll enable timestamps for your Mongoose models. Mongoose will
automatically track when documents were created and updated. This is great data to have
if you want to allow users to sort by when the document was created or updated.

Enabling Mongoose Timestamps

Schema options can be used to enable timestamps. Schema options are provided by
passing an object in as the second argument to `mongoose.Schema`. Set `timestamps` to `true`
to have Mongoose add `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields to the model. You don’t need to
write any code to create or manage those fields, as Mongoose does all that for you.

```js
const taskSchema = new mongoose.Schema(
  {
    //Task fields omitted for brevity
  },
  {
    timestamps: true,
  }
);
const Task = mongoose.model("Task", taskSchema);
```

---

### Filtering Data

In this lesson, you’ll use query parameters to allow for data filtering. This will allow clients
to fetch all tasks, just the complete tasks, or just the incomplete tasks.

Filtering Data

`GET /tasks` below supports a `completed` query parameter which can be set to `true` or
`false`. This will prevent clients from fetching unnecessary data that they don’t plan on
using.

First up, create an object to store the search criteria.

```js
const match = {};
```

From there, check if the query parameter was provided. The provided value should be
parsed into a boolean and stored on `match.completed`.

```js
if (req.query.completed) {
  match.completed = req.query.completed === "true";
}
```

Last up, `match` can be added onto `populate` to fetch just the users that match the search
criteria.

```js
await req.user
  .populate({
    path: "tasks",
    match,
  })
  .execPopulate();
```

---

### Paginating Data

In this lesson, you’ll add pagination to the application. This will allow the client to fetch data
in pages. The client can start off with the first page of data and then fetch other pages as
they’re needed.

Data Pagination

Pagination is configured using `limit` and `skip`. These two values give the client complete
control of the data they’re getting back.

If a client wanted the first page of 10 tasks, `limit` would be set to `10` and `skip` would be
set to `0`. If the client wanted the third page of 10 tasks, `limit` would be set to `10` and `skip`
would be set to `20`.

Both `limit` and `skip` can be added onto the `options` object passed to `populate`. The
code below uses `parseInt` to convert the string query parameters into numbers first.

```js
await req.user
  .populate({
    path: "tasks",
    match,
    options: {
      limit: parseInt(req.query.limit),
      skip: parseInt(req.query.skip),
    },
  })
  .execPopulate();
```

---

### Sorting Data

In this lesson, you’ll add sorting to the application. Clients will be able to fetch the data
back in any order they like.

Sorting Data

The `options` object used for pagination can also be used for sorting. A `sort` property
should be set, which is an object containing key/value pairs. The key is the field to sort.
The value is `1` for ascending and `-1` for descending sorting.

`GET /tasks` will get support for a `sortBy` query parameter. The value should include the
field to sort and the order in which to sort. `createdAt:asc` would sort the tasks in
ascending order with the oldest first. `createdAt:asc` would sort the tasks in a descending
order with the newest first.

Start with an empty object to store the sorting options.

```js
const sort = {};
```

If the query parameter is provided, it’ll get parsed and `sort` will be updated.

```js
if (req.query.sortBy) {
  const parts = req.query.sortBy.split(":");
  sort[parts[0]] = parts[1] === "desc" ? -1 : 1;
}
```

sort is then added onto `options`. If `sortBy` isn’t provided, `sort` will be an empty object
and no sorting will occur.

```js
await req.user
  .populate({
    path: "tasks",
    match,
    options: {
      limit: parseInt(req.query.limit),
      skip: parseInt(req.query.skip),
      sort,
    },
  })
  .execPopulate();
```

---

## File Uploads

### Section Intro: File Uploads

In this section, you’ll learn how to configure Node.js to support file uploads. This will allow
users to upload documents, profile pictures, and any other file type you might need to
support. You’ll also see what it takes to store the uploaded files in MongoDB.

---

### Adding Support for File Uploads

In this lesson, you’ll set up multer. Multer is a library in the Express ecosystem that allows
your Express application to easily support file uploads. It couldn’t be easier

Configuring Multer

First up, install the library.

```sh
npm i multer@1.4.1
```

Multer can then be configured to fit your specific needs. The example below shows off a
basic configuration where `dest` is set to `avatars`. This will store all uploaded files in a
directory called `avatars`.

```js
const multer = require("multer");
const upload = multer({
  dest: "avatars",
});
```

Multer is then added as middleware for the specific endpoint that should allow for file
uploads. The route below is expecting a single `avatar` field on the submitted form.

```js
router.post("/users/me/avatar", upload.single("avatar"), (req, res) => {
  res.send();
});
```

[NPM Multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer)

---

### Validating File Uploads

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to validate file uploads. This will allow you to reject files that
are too large or files of the wrong type.

Validating Multer Uploads

The multer configuration below adds these two types of validation.

`limits.fileSize` is set to limit the file size in bytes. The configuration below uses
1,000,000 bytes which is equivalent to 1 megabyte.

`fileFilter` is set to validate the file type. The method below will reject all documents that
don’t have either `.doc` or `.docx` file extensions. This same technique could be used to limit
uploads to just images, PDFs, or any other file type.

```js
const upload = multer({
  dest: "images",
  limits: {
    fileSize: 1000000,
  },
  fileFilter(req, file, cb) {
    if (!file.originalname.match(/\.(doc|docx)$/)) {
      return cb(new Error("Please upload a Word document"));
    }
    cb(undefined, true);
  },
});
```

### Validation Challenge

In this video, we looked at how we can accept file uploads from a certain route. We used `multer` to limit the file size as well as the file type.

```js
// Upload profile avatar
const upload = multer({
  dest: "avatars",
  limits: {
    fileSize: 1000000,
  },
  fileFilter(req, file, cb) {
    if (!file.originalname.match(/\.(jpg|jpeg|png])$/)) {
      return cb(new Error("Please upload an image"));
    }
    cb(undefined, true);
  },
});

router.post("/users/me/avatar", upload.single("avatar"), (req, res) => {
  res.send();
});
```

---

### Handling Express Errors

In this lesson, you’ll customize the errors that multer provides. This will give you complete
control of what sort of response the client gets when their upload is rejected.

Handling Express Errors

You can handle errors from middleware function by providing a function to Express. As
shown below, a new function is passed as the final argument to `router.post`. This function
accepts `error`, `req`, `res`, and `next`. This call signature lets Express know the function is
designed to handle errors.

The function itself sends back a JSON response with the error message from multer.

```js
router.post(
  "/users/me/avatar",
  upload.single("avatar"),
  (req, res) => {
    res.send();
  },
  (error, req, res, next) => {
    res.status(400).send({ error: error.message });
  }
);
```

---

### Adding Images to User Profile

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to associate the uploaded avatar with the users account.

Adding Images to the User Profile

A new field needs to be added to the user model to store the avatar image data. The
snippet below adds `avatar` on the user with the type of `Buffer`. The `Buffer` type should
be used when storing binary data, which is exactly the type of data that multer provides.

```js
// Existing code omitted for brevity
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  avatar: {
    type: Buffer,
  },
});
```

The avatar upload route will be able to change the user profile data, so the route should
be put behind authentication. The handler function grabs the binary data and stores it on
the `avatar` field. Finally, the changes are saved.

```js
router.post(
  "/users/me/avatar",
  auth,
  upload.single("avatar"),
  async (req, res) => {
    req.user.avatar = req.file.buffer;
    await req.user.save();
    res.send();
  },
  (error, req, res, next) => {
    res.status(400).send({ error: error.message });
  }
);
```

---

### Serving up Files

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to serve up user profile images. These images will be
served up as if they were static assets for the application.

Serving up Files

Serving up the user avatars will require two pieces of data from the server. The first is the
image data, and the second is the `Content-Type` header. The image data is stored on the
user profile. The header should be set equal to `image/png` which lets the client know
they’re getting a PNG image back.

The route below fetches the image data and sets the `Content-Type` header for the
response. The URL could be visited to view the profile picture.

```js
router.get("/users/:id/avatar", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const user = await User.findById(req.params.id);
    if (!user || !user.avatar) {
      throw new Error();
    }
    res.set("Content-Type", "image/jpg");
    res.send(user.avatar);
  } catch (e) {
    res.status(404).send();
  }
});
```

---

### Auto-Cropping and Image Formatting

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to resize and format images. This will let you create uniform
sizes and file types for user avatars.

Auto-Cropping and Image Formatting

First up, install the npm library.

```sh
npm i sharp@0.21.1
```

Now, sharp can be used to manipulate uploaded images. Before the image data is added
onto the user profile, the data should be passed through sharp. The example below uses
`resize` to resize all uploads to 250 by 250 pixels. The example also uses `png` to convert
all images to portable network graphics. Lastly, `toBuffer` is used to retrieve the modified
image data. The modified data is what should be saved in the database.

```js
const sharp = require("sharp");
const buffer = await sharp(req.file.buffer)
  .resize({ width: 250, height: 250 })
  .png()
  .toBuffer();
```

[NPM sharp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sharp)

## Sending Emails

### Section Intro: Sending Emails

In this section, you’ll add email sending to your Node.js application! This will allow you to
communicate with users as they use the app. This could be useful for welcome emails,
notifications, and more!

---

### Exploring SendGrid

In this lesson, you’ll integrate SendGrid into your Node app. SendGrid is one of many
services that allow you to send emails from your application code.

Exploring SendGrid

First up, install the module.

```sh
npm i sendgrid/mail@6.3.1
```

Next, create a free SendGrid account and get your API key. Check out the lesson video to
learn how to get your API key. The code below shows what’s necessary to get the
SendGrid module configured. All you need to do is call `setApiKey` to... well... set your API
key.

```js
const sgMail = require("@sendgrid/mail");
sgMail.setApiKey(
  "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"
);
```

`send` can be called to send an email from your application. The configuration object can be
used to provide:

- `to` - Who is the email to?
- `from` - Who is the email from?
- `subject` - What’s the subject line of the email?
- `text` - What’s the body of the email.

```js
sgMail.send({
  to: "andrew@mead.io",
  from: "andrew@mead.io",
  subject: "This is my first creation!",
  text: "I hope this one actually get to you.",
});
```

In the long term, you’ll want to purchase a custom domain and register it with SendGrid.
This will increase your sending reliability.

### Sending Welcome and Cancellation Emails

In this lesson, you’ll be sending email to users when they sign up or cancel their account.
There are no notes for this challenge video, as no new information is covered. The goal is
to give you experience using what was covered in previous lessons.

---

### Environment Variables

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to use environment variables to securely store API keys and
other credentials. This will reduce the chance your private keys fall into the wrong hands.

Environment Variables

First up, install the npm module.

```js
npm i env-cmd@8.0.2
```

Next up, create an environment file `dev.env` in the `config` directory. This will store your
environment variables in the following format.

```js
KEY=value
ANOTHER_KEY=some other value
```

Next, update the `dev` script to use env-cmd to load in those environment variables when it
starts up. That would be `env-cmd -f ./config/dev.env nodemon src/index.js`.

Now, you can remove API keys and database credentials from the application itself. For
example, you can create `MONGODB_URL` in the development environment file. The
application code shown below can then reference that environment variable to get its
value. This can be done with the SendGrid API key and the JWT secret used to generate
and verify authentication tokens.

```js
mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGODB_URL, {
  useNewUrlParser: true,
  useCreateIndex: true,
  useFindAndModify: false,
});
```

[NPM env-cmd](https://www.npmjs.com/package/env-cmd)

### Creating a Production MongoDB Database

In this lesson, you’ll set up a production MongoDB database using MongoDB Atlas. Atlas is
the official MongoDB hosting platform released by the MongoDB organization.

Please refer to the video for the detailed steps required to set up the production
database.

---

### Heroku Deployment

In this lesson, you’ll deploy the task manager API to Heroku.

Heroku Deployment

You already know how to deploy Node.js applications to Heroku. The only difference with
this application is that your custom environment variables need to be configured on
Heroku too. This doesn’t include `PORT`, as that’s managed by Heroku.

The command below is used to set an environment variable.

```js
heroku config:set KEY=VALUE
```

A variation of that command can be used to fetch all the environment variables currently
configured.

```js
heroku config
```

Lastly, you can delete an environment variable as shown here.

```js
heroku config:unset KEY
```

---

## Testing Node.js

### Section Intro: Testing Node.js

In this section, you’ll learn how to test your Node.js applications. Setting up an automated
test suite makes it easy to check that your application is always working as expected.

---

### Jest Testing Framework

In this lesson, you’ll set up the Jest testing framework. Jest gives you everything you need
to create a test suite for your Node.js applications.

Setting up Jest

First up, install the module.

```sh
npm i jest --save-dev
```

Next, create a `test` script in `package.json`. The script itself is `jest`. This allows you to use
`npm test` to run the Jest test suite.

Now, you’ll need to create a test suite. This is a file in your project that ends with `.test.js`.
The file extension allows Jest to find and run the test suites for your project.

Creating a Test Case

You can add a test case to a test suite using the `test` function. Jest provides various
functions as global variables in your test suite files. `test` is one of them. The first argument
to test is the name of your test case. The second argument to `test` is the test function
itself.

If the test function throws an error, the test cast will fail. If the test function doesn’t throw an
error, the test case will pass.

The test case below would always pass, as no error is thrown.

```js
test("Hello world!", () => {});
```

The test case below would always fail, as it throws an error.

```js
test("This should fail", () => {
  throw new Error("Failure!");
});
```

[Jest](https://jestjs.io/)

---

### Writing Tests and Assertions

In this lesson, you’ll add assertions to your test cases. Assertions allow you check if a
given value is what you’re expecting or not.

Testing a Function

For this example, let’s test the `calculateTip` function shown below. All it does is calculate
the tip for your restaurant bill.

```js
const calculateTip = (total, tipPercent = 0.25) => total + total * tipPercent;
module.exports = {
  calculateTip,
};
```

The test suite below has a single test case for the `calculateTip` function. The test case
itself calculates a 30% tip on a $10 restaurant bill. The assertion checks that the calculated
total equals $13. The assertion is made using `toBe` to check for equality.

```js
const { calculateTip } = require("../src/math");
test("Should calculate total with tip", () => {
  const total = calculateTip(10, 0.3);
  expect(total).toBe(13);
});
```

[Expect](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect)

---

### Writing Your Own Tests

In this video, it’s on you to write some new test cases using what you’ve learned so far.

There are no notes for this challenge video, as no new information is covered. The goal is
to give you experience using what was covered in previous lessons.

---

### Testing Asynchronous Code

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to test asynchronous code. This will be necessary to test
the Express API endpoints.

Testing Asynchronous Code

The two test cases below test the asynchronous `add` function you created earlier in the
course. Both test cases add up 2 and 3 and assert that the total is 5.

The callback function for the first test case accepts a `done` parameter. This lets Jest know
that the test function contains asynchronous code. Jest won’t determine if the test passed
or failed until `done` is called. In the example below, `then` is called to run some code after
the numbers are added. This is where the assertion is added and it’s where `done` is called.

```js
test("Should add two numbers", (done) => {
  add(2, 3).then((sum) => {
    expect(sum).toBe(5);
    done();
  });
});
```

Your test cases can use async/await as well. The test case below is a refactored version of
the test case above. The test case function is defined with `async await` is used in the
function to ensure that Jest waits for those asynchronous tasks to complete. Both test
cases are functionally identical.

```js
test("Should add two numbers async/await", async () => {
  const sum = await add(2, 3);
  expect(sum).toBe(3);
});
```

### Testing an Express Application: Part 1

In this lesson, you’ll set up the Express API to be easily testable. This involves settings up a
test environment as well as configuring Jest to work with Node.

Creating a Test Environment

Creating the test environment requires `test.env` to be added to the `config` directory. The
contents will be identical to `dev.env`, with the exception of the MongoDB connection
string. The test environment should use a separate database such as `task-manager-api- test`. This will prevent the test cases from messing with development data.

With the environment in place, update the `test` script to load the environment file in. That
would be `env-cmd ./config/test.env jest --watch --runInBand`.

Configuring Jest

By default, `Jest` is expecting to run in the browser. You can use Jest with Node, but you’ll
need to configure Jest to enable support. Jest can be configured by adding a `jest` property in
`package.json`. The configuration below sets `testEnvironment` to `node` to
ensure that Jest runs correctly in Node.js.

```json
{
  "jest": {
    "testEnvironment": "node"
  }
}
```

### Testing an Express Application: Part 2

In this lesson, you’ll add tests for the Express API. Each test case will focus on testing a
specific endpoint, making assertions about the response from the server.

Testing with Supertest

Supertest was created by the Express team to allow you to easily test your Express apps.
First up, install the module.

`npm i supertest`

Now, supertest can be used to test an endpoint. The test case below tests that new users
can sign up for accounts. All the account data provided is valid, so a new account should
be created.

Step one is to pass the express `app` to `request`. Next, supertest methods can be chained
together to fit the needs of your tests. `post` is used to make an HTTP POST request to
`/users`. `send` is used to send the correct JSON data to the server. `expect` is used to assert
that the response status code is correct. In this case, a successful signup should result in a
`201` status code.

### Jest Setup and Teardown

In this lesson, you’ll configure Jest to add test data into the database. This will allow you to
test operations that require existing data, such as the login operation. You can’t log in if
there isn’t a user account in the database to login to.

Seeding Database

Jest provides lifecycle functions that you can use to configure your test suite. There are
four:

1. `beforeEach` - Run some code before each test case
2. `afterEach` - Run some code after each test case
3. `before` - Run some code once before the tests run
4. `after` - Run some code once after the tests run

`beforeEach` works great for adding test data to the database. The `beforeEach` call below
removes all users and then adds a single test user into the database. By having this run
before each test case, it ensures that the tests run in a consistent environment each time
they execute.

```js
const User = require("../src/models/user");
const userOne = {
  name: "Mike",
  email: "mike@example.com",
  password: "56what!!",
};
beforeEach(async () => {
  await User.deleteMany();
  await new User(userOne).save();
});
```

With the test user in place, the test case below is able to test the login operation by
logging in as the test user.

```js
test("Should login existing user", async () => {
  await request(app)
    .post("/users/login")
    .send({
      email: userOne.email,
      password: userOne.password,
    })
    .expect(200);
});
```

### Testing with Authentication

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to test API endpoints that sit behind authentication.

Testing with Authentication

The goal is to test operations that require authentication. This means an authentication
token will need to be passed along with the request. Step one is to create an
authentication token for the test user.

```js
const userOneId = new mongoose.Types.ObjectId();
const userOne = {
  _id: userOneId,
  name: "Mike",
  email: "mike@example.com",
  password: "56what!!",
  tokens: [
    {
      token: jwt.sign({ _id: userOneId }, process.env.JWT_SECRET),
    },
  ],
};
```

From there, the authentication token can be added as part of the supertest request.
Supertest provides a set method for setting request headers. The test case below
attempts to fetch the user profile for the logged-in user.

```js
test('Should get profile for user', async () => {
await request(app)
.get('/users/me')
.set('Authorization', `Bearer ${userOne.tokens[0].token}`)
.send()
.expect(200)
};
```

### Advanced Assertions

In this lesson, it’s up to you to write some test cases on your own.
There are no notes for this challenge video, as no new information is covered. The goal is
to give you experience using what was covered in previous lessons.

### Mocking Libraries

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to mock npm modules. Jest lets you mock npm modules so
you can override module functionality in your test environment.

Mocking SendGrid

You can mock an npm module by creating a `__mocks__` directory in the `tests` folder. A
module can be mocked by creating a file in the `__mocks__` folder. The file name should
match up with the module name, so `tests/__mocks__/express.js` can be used to mock
the Express library. If the npm module uses a scope like `@sendgrid/mail`, then a
`@sendgrid` folder would be created with a `mail.js` file inside.

The job of the mock file is to provide mocked versions of the library features. The
SendGrid mock below defines and exports `setApiKey` and `send`. This ensures that our
code still works even though emails will no longer be sent for the tests.

```js
module.exports = {
  setApiKey() {},
  send() {},
};
```

### Wrapping up User Tests

In this lesson, it’s your job to finalize the user tests.

There are no notes for this challenge video, as no new information is covered. The goal is
to give you experience using what was covered in previous lessons.

### Setup Task Test Suite

In this lesson, you’ll be refactoring the user test suite. These changes will makes it
possible to test the task operations too.

Refer to the video for refactoring instructions. The refactoring requires lots of code to be
shifted between files, which is a little more than could be covered in this guide.

---

### Testing with Task Data

In this lesson, you’ll be writing some test cases for tasks.

Testing with Task Data

Testing tasks will require that some test tasks exist in the database. Like with users, tasks
can be added to the database using `beforeEach`. The test case below fetches all tasks for
the user. It also asserts that the status code is a `200` and the tasks are sent back correctly.

```js
test("Should fetch user tasks", async () => {
  const response = await request(app)
    .get("/tasks")
    .set("Authorization", `Bearer ${userOne.tokens[0].token}`)
    .send()
    .expect(200);
  expect(response.body.length).toEqual(2);
});
```
