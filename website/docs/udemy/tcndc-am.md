## Welcome

### Welcome to the Class

1. Exploring the Course Curriculum
   This course is split into 4 main sections.
   In part 1, we're going to build a note taking app.
   In part 2, we're going to build a weather app.
   In part 3, we're going to build a task-manager app.
   In part 4, we're going to build a real-time chat app.

2. Learn by Writing Code
   In the beginning, we're going to learn by coping what we see. This is essential in exploring new features for the first time, but not good for building up your problem solving capabilities, which is why there are many personal challenges involved.

3. Tips for Asking Questions
   The course Q&A is where you can go to get help if your app randomly crashes, or something's not compiling correctly.

## Installing and Exploring Node.js

### Section Intro: Installing and Exploring Node.js

We'll be setting up Node.js and a text editor that works very well with Node.js.

---

### Installing Node.js and Visual Studio Code

To install Node.js, just download the most current version on nodejs.org and follow the install prompt. To make sure the latest version is installed, open the command prompt, and type `node -v`.

To install Visual Studio Code, just go to the website and follow the install instructions.

### What is Node.js?

Previously, JavaScript was limited to running on the browser. Node.js allows JavaScript to run outside of the browser on servers and machines. Node.js runs on the V8 JavaScript Engine from Chrome. This engine is written in C++ and helps the browser compile and read JavaScript code.

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime. This means that we write our code in regular JS and it will give us access to special tools and libraries.

![The V8 JavaScript Engine](./tcndc-am/static/tcndc-am1.png)

Node and JavaScript both rely heavily on the V8 engine. When we want to interact with some files, or something on the DOM, we are actually using C++ to do that, and when we write something in our code, we're just telling the V8 engine what it should do because it uses C++.

When we open the Command Prompt and type `node` in, we're put into what's called a REPL. Which stands for Read Evaluate Print Loop, and it lets us run some simple node commands.

What are some of the differences? With regular JS, we can call the `window` or `document` property and it will give us lots of options to do with the browser window,but this isn't available in Node.js because we don't interact with the browser window.

Some node functions include `process`, and `process.exit()`

---

### Why Should I Use Node.js

"Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient." I/O stands for Input Output, and Node uses I/O anytime it communicates with the outside world. Non-blocking means that while Node is waiting for something to happen, it can continue processing other things.

![Blocking vs Non-Blocking](./tcndc-am/static/tcndc-am2.png)

NPM came preinstalled with Node. NPM contains packages for almost everything and is a very useful tool.

---

### Your First Node.js Script

We're going to set up a folder on the desktop, someplace to keep all of our scripts, and then open that in VSCode.

The first Node script is a simple `console.log()`, but it's important to note that console.log is not exclusive to JavaScript and isn't even part of the language itself, it's part of the runtime.

The Node documentation is available on the website, just select the version that is installed.

To run a simple Node script using the integrated terminal in VSCode, simply type `node` and add the file name that you want to run, `node hello.js`.

---

## Node.js Module System (Notes App)

### Section Intro: Node.js Module System

In this section, the focus will be on the Node module system in three different ways. Importing core Node modules, 3rd party modules by other developers, and our own modules.

---

### Importing Node.js Core Modules

Node.js comes with dozens of built-in modules. These built-in modules, sometimes
referred to as core modules, give you access to tools for working with the file system,
making http requests, creating web servers, and more! In this lesson, you’ll learn how to load in those core modules and use them in your code.

Importing Node.js Core Modules
To get started, let’s work with some built-in Node.js modules. These are modules that
come with Node, so there’s no need to install them.

The module system is built around the require function. This function is used to load in a module and get access to its contents. require is a global variable provided to all your Node.js scripts, so you can use it anywhere you like!
Let’s look at an example.

```js
const fs = require("fs");
fs.writeFileSync("notes.txt", "I live in Philadelphia");
```

The script above uses require to load in the fs module. This is a built-in Node.js module
that provides functions you can use to manipulate the file system. The script uses
writeFileSync to write a message to notes.txt.

After you run the script, you’ll notice a new notes.txt file in your directory. Open it up and you’ll see, “I live in Philadelphia!”.

---

### Importing Your Own Files

Putting all your code in a single file makes it easy to get started with Node.js. As you add more code, you’ll want to stay organized and break your Node.js app into multiple scripts that all work together. In this lesson, you’ll learn how to create a Node.js application that’s spread out across multiple files.

Importing Your Own Files
You know how to use `require` to load in built-in modules. `require` can also be used to
load in JavaScript files you’ve created. All you need to do is provide `require` with a
relative path to the script you want to load. This path should start with ./ and then link to the file that needs to be loaded in.

```js
const checkUtils = require("./src/utils.js");
checkUtils();
```

The code above uses `require` to load in a file called `utils.js` in the src directory. It stores the module contents in a variable, and then uses the contents in the script.

Exporting from Files
Node.js runs the scripts that you require. That means the require call above will cause
`utils.js` to run. Node.js provides the required script with a place to store values that should be exported as part of the library. This is on `module.exports`.

You can see `utils.js` below. A function is defined and then assigned to `module.exports`. The value stored on `module.exports` will be the return value for `require` when the script is imported. That means other scripts could load in the utilities to access the `check` function.

```js
const check = function() {
  console.log("Doing some work...");
};
module.exports = check;
```

If you run the original script, you’ll see the message that logged from the `check` function in `utils.js`.

```js
Version 1.0 12
\$ node app.js
Doing some work...
```

Your Node.js scripts don’t share a global score. This means variables created in one
scripts are not accessible in a different script. The only way to share values between
scripts is by using `require` with `module.exports`.

---

### Importing npm Modules

When you install Node.js, you also get npm. npm is a package manager that allows you to
install and use third-party npm libraries in your code. This opens up a world of possibilities, as there are npm packages for everything from email sending to file uploading. In this lesson, you’ll learn how to integrate npm into your Node.js app.

Initializing npm

Your Node.js application needs to initialize npm before npm can be used. You can run `npm init` from the root of your project to get that done. That command will ask you a series of questions about the project and it’ll use the information to generate a `package.json` file in the root of your project.

Here’s an example.

```js
{
"name": "notes-app",
"version": "1.0.0",
"description": "",
"main": "app.js",
"scripts": {
"test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
},
"author": "",
"license": "ISC",
}
```

Installing an npm Module

You’re now ready to install an npm module. This is done using the `npm` command which
was set up when Node.js was installed. You can use `npm install` to install a new module
in your project.

`npm install validator@10.8.0`

The command above installs version 10.8.0 of validator. If you want to install the latest
version of a module, you can leave off the version number as shown below.

`npm install validator`

This command does three important things:
First, it creates a `node_modules` directory. npm uses this directory to store all the code for the npm modules you have installed.

Second, npm adds the module as a dependency by listing it in the `dependencies` property
in `package.json`. This allows you to track and manage the module you have installed.

Third, npm creates a `package-lock.json` file. This includes detailed information about the modules you’ve installed which helps keep things fast and secure.

You should never make changes to `node_modules` or `package-lock.json`. Both are
managed by npm and will get changed as you run npm commands from the terminal.

Importing an npm Module

npm modules can be imported into your script using `require`. To load in an npm module,
pass the npm module name to `require`.

```js
const validator = require("validator");
console.log(validator.isURL("https/mead.io")); // Print: true
```

The script above uses `require` to load in validator. The script then uses the `isURL` function provided by validator to check if a given string contains a valid URL.

- [npm: validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/validator)

### Printing in Color

In this lesson, we were tasked with installing and using an npm package that we have no experience with. The package was called `chalk` and was a library that allows us to style our console.log messages with colors and background colors and cool text decorations.
To start, visit the [NPM chalk page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk) and follow the download instructions. `npm install chalk`. From there we need to require the package inside of our file using the `require` keyword. `const chalk = require("chalk")`
Then, we can write a console.log and pass in the arguments we want. The API docs are very beneficial in explaining what each property available is. To console.log a green background with bold white text, I used this code.

```js
// npm install chalk
const chalk = require("chalk");
console.log(chalk.whiteBright.bold.bgGreen("Success!"));
```

---

### Global npm Modules and nodemon

You can use npm modules from outside of your scripts by installing them globally. Globally installed modules are designed to be used from the terminal and provide you with new commands you can run. In this lesson, you’ll learn how to install and work with global modules.

Installing an npm Module Globally
npm modules can be installed globally by adding a `-g` flag to the installation command.
Not all modules are designed to be installed globally, so be sure to refer to the module
documentation to learn how it’s supposed to be used.

The command below installs version 1.18.5 of nodemon as a global module.

`npm install -g nodemon@1.18.5`

A globally installed module is not added as a dependency to your project. That means you
won’t see it listed in `package.json` or `package-lock.json`. You also won’t find its code in `node_modules`. Globally installed modules are located in a special directory in your machine which is created and managed by npm.

When you install nodemon globally, you get access a new `nodemon` command from the
terminal. This can be used to start and Node.js application and then restart the application any of the app scripts change. This means you won’t need to switch between the terminal and text editor to restart your application every time you make a change.

The command below runs `app.js` through nodemon.

`nodemon app.js`

P.S. You can stop nodemon by using `ctrl + c` from the terminal!

## File System and Command Line Args (Notes App)

### Section Intro: File System and Command Line Args

This section focuses on 2 main topics. The first is using the file system, and the second is command line arguments. The file system allows us to store the users note data and command line arguments are going to allow us to get data from the user.

---

### Getting Input from Users

I can’t think of a single useful application that doesn’t get input from the users. Whether it’s their email, location, or age, getting input is essential for creating real-world apps. In this lesson, you’ll learn how to set up command line arguments that allow users to pass data into your application.

Accessing Command Line Arguments

Command line arguments are values passed into your application from the terminal. Your
Node.js application can access the command line arguments that were provided using
`process.argv`. This array contains at least two items. The first is the path to the Node.js executable. The second is the path to the JavaScript file that was executed. Everything after that is a command line argument.

Take a look at the example below.

```js
const command = process.argv[2];

if (command === "add") {
  console.log("Adding note!");
} else if (command === "remove") {
  console.log("Removing note!");
}
```

That script grabs the third item in `process.argv`. Since the first two are always provided, the third item is the first command line argument that was passed in. The script uses the value of that argument to figure out what it should do. A user could provide add to add a note or remove to remove a note.

The command below runs the script and provides add as the command line argument.

```node
node app.js add
Adding note!
```

### Argument Parsing with Yargs: Part 1

Node.js provides a bare-bones way to access command line arguments. While it’s a good
start, it doesn’t provide any way to parse more complex command line arguments. In this
lesson, you’ll learn how to use Yargs to easily set up a more complex set of arguments for your application.

Setting Up Yargs
First, install Yargs in your project.

`npm install yargs@12.0.2`

Now, yargs can be used to make it easier to work with command line arguments. The
example below shows how this can be done. First, `yargs.version` is used to set up a
version for the command line tool. Next, `yargs.command` is used to add support for a new command.

```js
const yargs = require("yargs");
yargs.version("1.1.0");
yargs.command({
  command: "add",
  describe: "Add a new note",
  handler: function() {
    console.log("Adding a new note!");
  }
});
console.log(yargs.argv);
```

Now, this command can be triggered by providing its name as a command line argument.

```terminal
node app.js add
Adding a new note!
```

Yargs provides a couple useful commands by default. The first, shown below, lets a user
get the version of the command line tool they’re running.

```terminal
node app.js --version
1.1.0
```

The second, shown below, shows the user autogenerated documentation that covers how
the tool can be used. This would list out all available commands as well as the available options for each command.

```terminal
node app.js --help
```

---

### Argument Parsing with Yargs: Part 2

In this lesson, you’ll continue to explore Yargs. The goal is to allow users to pass in the title and body of their notes using command line options. This same technique could be used to allow users to pass in data such as their name, email, or address.

Adding Command Options
Options are additional pieces of information passed along with the command. You can set
up options for a command using the `builder` property as shown below.

Now, the add command can be used with two options. The first is `title` which is used for the title of the note being added. The second is `body` which is used for the body of the note being added. Both options are required because `demandOption` is set to `true`. Both are also set up to accept string input because `type` is set to `'string'`.

```js
yargs.command({
  command: "add",
  describe: "Add a new note",
  builder: {
    title: {
      describe: "Note title",
      demandOption: true,
      type: "string"
    },
    body: {
      describe: "Note body",
      demandOption: true,
      type: "string"
    }
  },
  handler: function(argv) {
    console.log("Title: " + argv.title);
    console.log("Body: " + argv.body);
  }
});
```

The add command can now be used with `--title` and `--body`.

```js
node app.js add --title="Buy" --body="Note body here"

Title: Buy
Body: Note body here
```

---

### Storing Data with JSON

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to work with JSON. JSON, which stands for JavaScript
Object Notation, is a lightweight data format. JSON makes it easy to store or transfer data.
You’ll be using it in this application to store users notes in the file system.

Working with JSON

Since JSON is nothing more than a string, it can be used to store data in a text file or
transfer data via an HTTP requests between two machines.

JavaScript provides two methods for working with JSON. The first is `JSON.stringify` and
the second is `JSON.parse`. `JSON.stringify` converts a JavaScript object into a JSON
string, while `JSON.parse` converts a JSON string into a JavaScript object.

```js
const book = {
  title: "Ego is the Enemy",
  author: "Ryan Holiday"
};
// Covert JavaScript object into JSON string
const bookJSON = JSON.stringify(book);
// Covert JSON string into object
const bookObject = JSON.parse(bookJSON);
console.log(bookObject.title); // Print: Ego is the Enemy
```

JSON looks similar to a JavaScript object, but there are some differences. The most
obvious is that all properties are wrapped in double-quotes. Single-quotes can’t be used
here, as JSON only supports double-quotes. You can see this in the example JSON
below.

```js
{"name":"Gunther","planet":"Earth","age":54}
```

---

### Adding a Note

In this lesson we set up a function to add a new note, and we also set up a process to check if the note is a duplicate note. If the note is a duplicate, then it doesn't add the new note to the json file.

---

### Removing a Note

Our challenge was to wire up a function that removed a note. To do this, we first set up a handler to make a title string a required functionality. Then we made a function that checks if the note title matches a note that's already in our object. Then we remove it.

---

### ES6 Aside: Arrow Functions

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to use ES6 arrow functions. Arrow functions come with a
few great features, making them a nice alternative to the standard ES5 function. You’ll
explore the new syntax and learn when to use them!

Arrow Functions

Arrow functions offer up an alternative syntax from the standard ES5 function. The snippet
below shows an example of a standard function and then an arrow function. While the
syntax is obviously different, you still have the two important pieces, an arguments list and
a function body.

```js
// const square = function (x) {
// return x * x
// }
const square = x => {
  return x * x;
};
console.log(square(2)); // Will print: 4
```

Shorthand Syntax

Arrow functions have an optional shorthand syntax. This is useful when you have a
function that immediately returns a value. The example below shows how this can be
used.

```js
const squareAlt = x => x * x;
console.log(squareAlt(2)); // Will print: 4
```

Notice that two important things are missing from the function definition. First, the curly
braces wrapping the function body have been removed as well as the `return` statement.
In place of both is the value to be returned. There’s no need for an explicit return
statement, as the value provide is implicitly returned.

This Binding

Arrow functions don’t bind their own `this` value. Instead, the `this` value of the scope in
which it was defined is accessible. This makes arrow functions bad candidates for
methods, as `this` won’t be a reference to the object the method is defined on.

For methods, ES6 provides a new method definition syntax. You can see this in the
definition of the `printGuestList` method below. That function is a standard function, just
with a shorthand syntax which allows for the removal of the colon and the function
keyword.

Because arrow functions don’t bind this, they work well for everything except methods. As
shown below, the arrow function passed to `forEach` is able to access `this.name` correctly,
as it’s defined as an arrow function and doesn’t have a this binding of its own. That code
wouldn’t work if you swapped out the arrow function for a standard function.

```js
const event = {
  name: "Birthday Party",
  guestList: ["Andrew", "Jen", "Mike"],
  printGuestList() {
    console.log("Guest list for " + this.name);

    this.guestList.forEach(guest => {
      console.log(guest + " is attending " + this.name);
    });
  }
};
event.printGuestList();
```

[MDN Arrow Function Expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions)

---

### Refactoring to Use Arrow Functions

In this module we learned about refactoring and arrow functions. We changed all of our regular function expressions to arrows.

Regular vs Arrow

```js
function hello(name) {
  console.log(name);
}

param => {
  console.log(param);
};

// Or, if all we're doing is returning one value we can use an even shorter syntax
param => param + "Hi";
// This just returns param + the string hi
```

---

### Listing Notes

We were required to write a function that will list out all of the notes when we run the list command.

```js
const listNotes = () => {
  const notes = loadNotes();
  console.log(chalk.green.inverse("Your Notes"));
  notes.forEach(element => {
    console.log(element.title);
  });
};
```

After exporting it and adding it as an event handler, this will return all of the note titles.

---

### Reading a Note

In this lesson, you’ll add a new app feature that allows users to read a note.

Array Find method

The find method allows you to find a single item in an array. It’s similar to `filter`, though `find` returns a single element as opposed to an array of elements. `find` will stop its search `through` the array after finding the first match.

The example below shows how find can be used to locate the user whose name is
George Hudson.

```js
const users = [
  {
    name: "Andrew Mead",
    age: 27
  },
  {
    name: "George Hudson",
    age: 72
  },
  {
    name: "Clay Klay",
    age: 45
  }
];
const user = users.find(user => user.name === "George Hudson");
console.log(user); // Will print the second object in the array
```

## Debugging Node.js (Notes App)

### Section Intro

What’s worse than getting an error when you run your application? Not knowing how to fix
it. In this section, you’ll learn how to effectively debug your Node.js apps. You’ll learn how to track down and fix issues so you can get back to the important work.

---

### Debugging Node.js

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to debug your Node.js applications. Node comes with a
great set of tools for getting to the bottom of any bug or programming issue.

Console.log

While it’s nice to have advanced debugging tools at the ready, there’s nothing wrong with
using `console.log` to debug your application. It’s not the fanciest technique, but it works,
and I use it daily.

When in doubt, use a few calls to `console.log` to figure out what’s going on. It’s great for
dumping a variable to the terminal so you can check its value. It also works for figuring out
what order your code is running in.

Node Debugger

Printing values to the console with `console.log` is a good start, but there are often times
where we need a more complete debugging solution. For that, Node.js ships with a built-in
debugger. It builds off of the developer tools that Chrome and V8 use when debugging
JavaScript code in the browser.

Start your application with inspect to use the debugger.

`node inspect app.js`

Next, visit `chrome://inspect` in the Chrome browser. There, you’ll see a list of all the
Node.js processes that you’re able to debug. Click “inspect” next to your Node.js process
to open up the developer tools. From there, you can click the blue “play” button near the
top-right of the “sources” tab to start up the application.

When running the app in debug mode, you can add breakpoints into your application to
stop it at a specific point in the code. This gives you a chance to explore to the application
state and figure out what’s going wrong.

```js
console.log('Thing one)
debugger // Debug tools will pause here until your click play again
console.log('Thing two)
```

[Node.js debugger documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/debugger.html)

### Error Messages

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to read error messages. Error messages contain useful
information about what went wrong, but they can be a pain to read. Learning how to read
them will let you fix errors fast.

Error Messages

Error messages can be daunting to use at first. They contain a lot of useful information, but
only if you know what you’re looking at. Let’s start with a complete error. Below is an error
I generated by trying to reference a variable that was never defined.

```js
/Users/Andrew/Downloads/n3-04-08-arrow-functions/playground/2-arrowfunction.js:21
 console.log(guest + ' is attending ' + eventName)
 ^
ReferenceError: eventName is not defined
 at guestList.forEach (/Users/Andrew/Downloads/n3-04-08-arrowfunctions/playground/2-arrow-function.js:21:52)
 at Array.forEach (<anonymous>)
 at Object.printGuestList (/Users/Andrew/Downloads/n3-04-08-arrowfunctions/playground/2-arrow-function.js:20:24)
 at Object.<anonymous> (/Users/Andrew/Downloads/n3-04-08-arrowfunctions/playground/2-arrow-function.js:26:7)
 at Module._compile (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:707:30)
 at Object.Module._extensions..js (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:718:10)
 at Module.load (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:605:32)
 at tryModuleLoad (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:544:12)
 at Function.Module._load (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:536:3)
 at Function.Module.runMain (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:760:12)
```

The first few lines of the error contain the most useful information.

The first line contains a path to the exact script where the error was thrown. It also
contains the line number. Using that line, you could tell that the issue is on line 21 of `2-arrow-function.js`.

The second line shows the line of code that caused the error.

The third line just below uses the “^” character to point to the specific part of the line that
the error came from.

The fourth line is blank.

The fifth line contains the error message from V8.

Everything after the fifth line is part of the stack trace. This shows a list of all the functions
that were running to get to the point where the program crashed. The top of the stack
trace starts with the function which threw the error. Here, we can see that the error was
thrown in a callback function for a `forEach` method call. If you got down to the next line,
you’ll figure out that the `forEach` call happened inside of `printGuestList`.

It’ll take a few tries to get comfortable with error messages. Each error you fix makes it
easier to fix the next one.

## Asynchronous Node.js

### Section Intro: Asynchronous Node.js

If we read an article about what Node.js is, we'll likely see these 4 terms.
Asynchronous, Non-Blocking, Single-Threaded, and Event Driven.
What do these terms mean and how do they affect the Node apps we're building?
We'll figure out how these terms fit into our apps by building a weather app with a frontend and a backend that will handle our frontend requests.

It’s time to connect your application with the outside world. In this section, you’ll explore
the asynchronous nature of Node.js. You’ll learn how to use asynchronous programming
to make HTTP API requests to third-party HTTP APIs. This will allow you to pull in data, like
real-time weather data, into your app.

---

### Asynchronous Basics

In this lesson, you’ll explore the basics of asynchronous development. You’ll get a preview
of what asynchronous code looks like and how it’s different from synchronous code.

Async 101

When running asynchronous code, your code won’t always execute in the order you might
expect. To get started with asynchronous development, let’s use `setTimeout`.

`setTimeout` is a function that allows you to run some code after a specific amount of time
has passed. `setTimeout` accepts two arguments. The first is a callback function. This
function will run after the specified amount of time has passed. The second argument is
the amount of time in milliseconds to wait.
Here’s an example.

```js
console.log("Starting");
// Wait 2 seconds before running the function
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("2 Second Timer");
}, 2000);
console.log("Stopping");
```

Run the script and you’ll see the logs in the following order.

```js
$ node app.js
Starting
Stopping
2 Second Timer
```

Notice that “Stopping” prints before “2 Second Timer”. That’s because `setTimeout` is
asynchronous and non-blocking. The `setTimeout` call doesn’t block Node.js from running
other code while it’s waiting for the 2 seconds to pass.

This asynchronous and non-blocking nature makes Node.js ideal for backend
development. Your server can wait for data from a database while also processing an
incoming HTTP request.

### Making HTTP Requests

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to make HTTP requests from Node. This will enable your
app to communicate with other APIs and servers to do a wide variety of things. Everything
from fetching real-time weather data to sending text messages to users.

Making HTTP Requests

There are several libraries that make it easy to fire off HTTP requests. My favorite is
request. You can install it using the command below.

`npm i request@2.88.0`

Before you use the library in your app, you’ll need to figure out which URL you’re trying to
fetch. To fetch real-time weather data, you’ll need to sign up for a free Dark Sky API
account. You can do that [here](https://darksky.net/dev).

Below is an example URL that responds with forecast data for San Francisco.

[https://api.darksky.net/forecast/9d1465c6f3bb7a6c71944bdd8548d026/37.8267,-122.4233](https://api.darksky.net/forecast/9d1465c6f3bb7a6c71944bdd8548d026/37.8267,-122.4233)

If you visit that URL in the browser, you’ll see that the response is JSON data. This same
data can be fetched by our Node.js app using the request library. The example below
fetches the forecast data and prints the current temperature to the console.

```js
const request = require('request')
const url =
'https://api.darksky.net/forecast/9d1465c6f3bb7a6c71944bdd8548d026/37.8267,-
122.4233';
request({ url: url }, (error, response) => {
 // Parse the response body from JSON string into JavaScript object
 const data = JSON.parse(response.body)
 // Will print the current temperature to the console
 console.log(data.currently.temperature)
})
```

---

### Customizing HTTP Requests

In this lesson, you’ll explore an option for the request library that allows it to automatically
parse JSON data into a JavaScript object.

Request Options

The request library comes with plenty of options to make your life easier. One is the `json`
option. Set `json` to `true` and request will automatically parse the JSON into a JavaScript
object for you.

```js
const request = require("request");
const url =
  "https://api.darksky.net/forecast/9d1465c6f3bb7a6c71944bdd8548d026/37.8267,-122.4233";
request({ url: url, json: true }, (error, response) => {
  console.log(
    response.body.daily.data[0].summary +
      " It is currently " +
      response.body.currently.temperature +
      " degrees out. There is a " +
      response.body.currently.precipProbability +
      "% chance of rain."
  );
});
```

The above program would print the following.

`Mostly cloudy overnight. It is currently 51.49 degrees out. There is a 0% chance of rain.`

There’s a link below where you can explore all available options.

### An HTTP Request Challenge

Our challenge was to be able to get the latitude and longitude values of a specific location using the Mapbox geolocation API.

I used the `request` npm module for this, but `Axios` is probably easier.

My request looked like this in the end.

```js
const geoURL =
  "https://api.mapbox.com/geocoding/v5/mapbox.places/Los%20Angeles.json?access_token=pk.eyJ1Ijoibmlja3JlaXNlbmF1ZXIiLCJhIjoiY2s3a3JqY294MDAxYzNobXUwb2UzYzV6biJ9.YQi9oFC0rW41CTNhzHAFng&limit=1";

request({ url: geoURL, json: true }, (error, response) => {
  const latitude = response.body.features[0].center[1];
  const longitude = response.body.features[0].center[0];
  console.log(
    `The lat and long of ${response.body.features[0].place_name} is ${longitude} longitude and ${latitude} latitude`
  );
});
```

---

### Handling Errors

There are plenty of reasons an HTTP request can fail. Maybe your machine doesn’t have
an internet connection, or maybe the URL is incorrect. Regardless of what goes wrong, in
this lesson, you’ll learn how to handle errors that occur when making HTTP requests.

Handling Errors

Handling errors is important. It would be nice if we could always provide the user with a
forecast for their location, but that’s not going to happen. When things fail, you should aim
to provide users with clear and useful messages in plain English so they know what’s
going on.

The callback function you pass to `request` expects an `error` and `response` argument to
be provided. Either `error` or `response` will have a value, never both. If `error` has a value,
that means things went wrong. In this case, `response` will be `undefined`, as there is no
response. If `response` has a value, things went well. In this case, `error` will be `undefined`,
as no error occurred.

The code below handles two different errors. The if statement first checks if error exists. If
it does, the program prints a message letting the user know it was unable to connect. The
second error occurs if there’s no match for the given address. In that case, the program
prints a message instructing the user to try a different search. Lastly, the coordinates are
printed to the console if neither error occurs.

```js
const request = require("request");
const geocodeURL =
  "https://api.mapbox.com/geocoding/v5/mapbox.places/philadelphia.json?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoiYW5kcmV3bWVhZDEiLCJhIjoiY2pvOG8ybW90MDFhazNxcnJ4OTYydzJlOSJ9.njY7HvaalLEVhEOIghPTlw&limit=1";

request({ url: geocodeURL, json: true }, (error, response) => {
  if (error) {
    console.log("Unable to connect to location services!");
  } else if (response.body.features.length === 0) {
    console.log("Unable to find location. Try another search.");
  } else {
    const latitude = response.body.features[0].center[0];
    const longitude = response.body.features[0].center[1];
    console.log(latitude, longitude);
  }
});
```

### The Callback Function

A callback function is a function that’s passed as an argument to another function. That’s it.
This is something you’ve used before, and in this lesson, you’ll dive a bit deeper into how
they work.

The Callback Function

A callback function is a function that’s passed as an argument to another function. Imagine
you have FunctionA which gets passed as an argument to FunctionB. FunctionB will do
some work and then call FunctionA at some point in the future.

Callback functions are at the core of asynchronous development. When you perform an
asynchronous operation, you’ll provide Node with a callback function. Node will then call
the callback when the async operation is complete. This is how you get access to the
results of the async operation, whether it’s an HTTP request for JSON data or a query to a
database for a user’s profile.

The example below shows how you can use the callback pattern in your own code. The
`geocode` function is set up to take in two arguments. The first is the address to geocode.
The second is the callback function to run when the geocoding process is complete. The
example below simulates this request by using `setTimeout` to make the process
asynchronous.

```js
const geocode = (address, callback) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    const data = {
      latitude: 0,
      longitude: 0
    };
    callback(data);
  }, 2000);
};
geocode("Philadelphia", data => {
  console.log(data);
});
```

The call to `geocode` provides both arguments, the address and the callback function.
Notice that the callback function is expecting a single parameter which it has called `data`.
This is where the callback function will get access to the results of the asynchronous
operation. You can see where `callback` is called with the data inside the `geocode`
function.

### Callback Abstraction

Callback functions can be used to abstract complex asynchronous code into a simple
reusable function. In this lesson, you’ll learn how to use this pattern to create a reusable
function for geocoding an address.

Callback Abstraction

Imagine you want to geocode an address from multiple places in your application. You
have two options. Option one, you can duplicate the code responsible for making the
request. This includes the call to request along with all the code responsible for handling
errors. However, this isn’t ideal. Duplicating code makes your application unnecessarily
complex and difficult to maintain. The solution is to create a single reusable function that
can be called whenever you need to geocode an address.

You can see an example of this below. The function `geocode` was created to serve as a
reusable way to geocode an address. It contains all the logic necessary to make the
request and process the response. `geocode` accepts two arguments. The first is the
address to geocode. The second is a callback function which will run once the geocoding
operation is complete.

```js
const request = require("request");

const geocode = (address, callback) => {
  const url = `https://api.mapbox.com/geocoding/v5/mapbox.places/${encodeURIComponent(
    address
  )}.json?access_token=pk.eyJ1Ijoibmlja3JlaXNlbmF1ZXIiLCJhIjoiY2s3a3JqY294MDAxYzNobXUwb2UzYzV6biJ9.YQi9oFC0rW41CTNhzHAFng&limit=1`;
  request({ url: url, json: true }, (error, response) => {
    if (error) {
      callback("Unable to connect to location services", undefined);
    } else if (response.body.features.length === 0) {
      callback("Unable to find location. Try another search", undefined);
    } else {
      callback(undefined, {
        latitude: response.body.features[0].center[0],
        longitude: response.body.features[0].center[1],
        location: response.body.features[0].place_name
      });
    }
  });
};

module.exports = geocode;
```

Now, `geocode` can be called as many times as needed from anywhere in your application.
The snippet below imports `geocode` and calls the function to get the latitude and longitude
for Boston.

```js
const geocode = require("./utils/geocode");
geocode("Boston", (error, data) => {
  console.log("Error", error);
  console.log("Data", data);
});
```

---

### Callback Abstraction Challenge

Our challenge was to provide a forecast util that will allow us to run a simple function that will fetch the forecast with arguments for lat and long.

```js
const request = require("request");

const forecast = (latitude, longitude, callback) => {
  const url = `https://api.darksky.net/forecast/48142fb7162954af695a6d0aeffd9a6e/${latitude},${longitude}?units=us`;
  request({ url: url, json: true }, (error, response) => {
    if (error) {
      callback("Unable to connect to location services", undefined);
    } else if (response.body.error) {
      callback("Unable to find location, try another search", undefined);
    } else {
      callback(
        undefined,
        `It is currently ${response.body.currently.temperature} degrees out. There is a ${response.body.currently.precipProbability}% chance of rain`
      );
    }
  });
};

module.exports = forecast;
```

And our function call

```js
forecast(-75.7088, 44.1545, (error, data) => {
  console.log("Error", error);
  console.log("Data", data);
});
```

---

### Callback Chaining

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to run one asynchronous operation only after another
asynchronous operation is complete. That’ll allow you to use the output from geocoding
as the input for fetching the weather.

Callback Chaining

When working with async code, you’ll often find out that you need to use the results from
one async operation as the input for another async operation. This is something we need
to do in the weather application too. Step one is to geocode the address. Step two is to
use the coordinates to fetch the weather forecast. You can’t start step two until step one is
complete.

You can start one operation after another finishes by using callback chaining. You can see
an example of this in the code below.

```js
// Other lines hidden for brevity
geocode(address, (error, data) => {
  if (error) {
    return console.log(error);
  }
  forecast(data.latitude, data.longitude, (error, forecastData) => {
    if (error) {
      return console.log(error);
    }
    console.log(data.location);
    console.log(forecastData);
  });
});
```

First up is the call to `geocode`. The call to `geocode` provides an address and a callback
function as it did before. It’s the code inside the callback function that looks a bit different.
The callback `function` calls forecast. This means that `forecast` won’t get called until after
`geocode` is complete. The latitude and longitude from the geocoding operation is also
provided as the input for the `forecast` function call.

### ES6 Aside: Object Property Shorthand and Destructuring

ES6 has done wonders making JavaScript easier to use. In this lesson, you’ll explore a
couple of features that make it easier to work with objects.

Property Shorthand

The property shorthand makes it easier to define properties when creating a new object. It
provides a shortcut for defining a property whose value comes from a variable of the same
name. You can see this in the example below where a `user` object is created. The `name`
property gets its value from a variable also called `name`.

```js
const name = "Andrew";
const userAge = 27;
const user = {
  name: name,
  age: userAge,
  location: "Philadelphia"
};
```

The shorthand allows you to remove the colon and the reference to the variable. When
JavaScript sees this, it’ll get the property value from the variable with the same name. The
example below uses the property shorthand to define `name` on the `user` object.

```js
const name = "Andrew";
const userAge = 27;
const user = {
  name,
  age: userAge,
  location: "Philadelphia"
};
console.log(user);
```

Object Destructuring

The second ES6 feature is object destructuring. Object destructuring gives you a syntax
for pulling properties off of objects and into standalone variables. This is useful when
working with the same object properties throughout your code. Instead of writing
`user.name` a dozen times, you could destructure the property into a `name` variable.

You can see an example of this below

```js
const user = {
  name: "Andrew",
  age: 27,
  location: "Philadelphia"
};
// The line below uses destructuring
const { age, location: address } = user;
console.log(age);
console.log(address);
```

`user` is destructured on line 8 above. The `age` property has been destructured and stored
in `age`. The `location` property has also been destructured and stored in `address`.

Destructuring Function Arguments

Destructuring works with function parameters as well. If an object is passed into a function,
it can be destructured inside the function definition. You can see this in the `transaction`
function below. The function accepts an object as its second argument. The `label` and
`stock` properties have both been destructured into standalone variables that become
available in the function.

```js
const product = {
  label: "Red notebook",
  price: 3,
  stock: 201,
  salePrice: undefined,
  rating: 4.2
};
const transaction = (type, { label, stock }) => {
  console.log(type, label, stock);
};
transaction("order", product);
```

### Bonus: HTTP Requests Without a Library

While the request library is great, it’s not necessary if you want to make HTTP requests
from Node. In this bonus lesson, you’ll learn how to make an HTTP request without
`request`.

The HTTPS Module

Node.js provides two core modules for making HTTP requests. The `http` module can be
used to make `http` requests and the `https` module can be used to make `https` requests.
One great feature about `request` is that it provides a single module that can make both
`http` and `https` requests.

The code below uses the https module to fetch the forecast from the Dark Sky API. Notice
there’s a lot more required to get things working. Separate callbacks are required for
incoming chunks of data, the end of the response, and the error for the request. This
means you’ll likely recreate your own function similar to request to make your life easier.
It’s best to stick with a tested and popular library like `request`.

```js
const https = require("https");
const url =
  "https://api.darksky.net/forecast/9d1465c6f3bb7a6c71944bdd8548d026/40,-75";
const request = https.request(url, response => {
  let data = "";
  response.on("data", chunk => {
    data = data + chunk.toString();
  });
  response.on("end", () => {
    const body = JSON.parse(data);
    console.log(body);
  });
});
request.on("error", error => {
  console.log("An error", error);
});
request.end();
```

## Web Servers

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD024 -->

### Section Intro

We'll be looking into express, as it allows us to easily create a website and let users interact with what we've made.

Node.js is commonly used as a web server to serve up websites, JSON, and more. In this
section, you’ll be creating your first Node server with Express. This will allow users to
interact with your application by visiting a URL in the browser.

---

### Hello Express!

Serving up websites and JSON data is easy with Express. In this lesson, you’ll learn how to
create your first web server with Express. Once the server is up and running, users will be
able to interact with your application via the browser.

To get started, add Express to your project. `npm i express`.

Next, you can require express. You get access to a single function you can call to create a
new Express application.

```js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
```

Now, `app` can be used to set up the server. Let’s start by showing a message when
someone visits the home page at `localhost:3000` and the weather page at
`localhost:3000/weather`.

```js
app.get("", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello express!");
});
app.get("/weather", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Your weather");
});
```

The code above uses `app.get` to set up a handler for an HTTP GET request. The first
argument is the path to set up the handler for. The second argument is the function to run
when that path is visited. Calling `res.send` in the route handler allows you to send back a
message as the response. This will get shown in the browser.

The last thing to do is start the server. This is done by calling `app.listen` with the port you
want to listen on.

This can be done using `app.listen` as shown below.

```js
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server is up on port 3000.");
});
```

If you run the app, you’ll see the message printing letting you know that the server is
running. This process will stay running until you shut it down. You can always use `ctrl + c` to terminate the process. Visit `localhost:3000` or `localhost:3000/weather` to view the
messages!

### Serving up HTML and JSON
