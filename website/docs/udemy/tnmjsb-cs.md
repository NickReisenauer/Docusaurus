## Introduction

### How This Course Works

There are 2 distinct parts. The first part is a start to finish intro to JavaScript for absolute beginners.
The second part is focused exclusively on projects, including some projects with node, express, MongoDB, etc...

If you run into trouble during the projects section of the course, just come back to the first half and rewatch the learning videos.

### JS, ECMA, TC39: What Do They Mean?

ECMA is simply an organization that defines many standards for technologies. ECMAScript is not a language, it is simply a language specification, saying things like the language should do this, have this functionality, use this feature, etc...

The way the naming system used to work is like ES6, and features were released every few years, but now it is updated yearly. Although the naming system is a bit off, for example ES6 refers to ES2015. This is why we need websites like [CanIUse](https://caniuse.com/)

---

### A Quick Note About MDN

Because JavaScript is constantly changing and there are so many different versions, we don't have any official documentation for the language. MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) provides a great resource for language documentation for JavaScript and other web questions you might have.

---

## JS Values & Variables

### Goals & Primitives

Goals:

- Work with primitive types
- Understand `let` and `const`
- Use String Template Literals
- Work with common operators/methods

Primitive Types:

- Number
- String
- Boolean
- Null
- Undefined

---

### Running Code in the JS Console

Normally, code is written in a separate .js file. For this first module the Chrome Developer Console will be used. The console is mainly used for testing and debugging purposes, not for actually writing your JavaScript.

---

### Introducing Numbers

![JS Numbers](./tnmjsb-cs/static/tnmjsb-cs1.png)

JavaScript does not store an infinitely precise number, `1.0000000000000009` becomes `1`.

![Simple Operations](./tnmjsb-cs/static/tnmjsb-cs2.png)

The modulo operator is a little bit different than regular division. What is does is it takes 2 numbers and divides them, and returns what's left over. For example... `27 % 2 = 1` because 2 can go into 26 evenly, so with 27 there's 1 that can't go in, so that's our remainder.

Another operator that is less well known is the exponential operator, and it's used for things like squaring and to the x power of. `2 ** 3 = 8`, or `5 ** 2 = 25`.

JavaScript numbers follow the rule of PEMDAS, so `3 - 9 * 2` will give us `-15`

---

### NaN & Infinity

NaN is a numeric value that represents something that is not a number. Some ways we can get NaN is by dividing 0 by 0, or by adding a number to NaN.

Infinity is a special value that we can get by doing something like 1/0. There's also -Infinity which can be accessed with -1/0.

---

### Numbers Quiz

What does these evaluate to??

```js
1.5 + 1.5 * 2;
// 4.5

(10 % 6) ** 2;
// 16

200 + 0 / 0;
// NaN
```

---

### Variables & Let

Variables are like "Labeled Jars" for a value in JavaScript. We can store a value and give it a name, so that we can...

- Recall it
- Use it
- Or change it later on

The basic syntax of a variable using `let` looks like this... `let someName = value;`

Updating values

```js
let hens = 4;
hens - 1; // 3
hens; // Still 4

// To actually change hens:
hens = hens - 1;
hens; // 3
```

We cannot redeclare already defined variables. We cannot use reserved words such as let, const, document, etc... for variable names.

---

### Unary Operators

Instead of writing `score = score + 10;` to update a variable, there's a shorthand method which will do the same thing. `score += 1;` will take score and add 1 to it.
`score -= 100;` will decrease the variable by 100.

```js
let score = 0;
score += 2;
score; // 2;

score -= 1;
score; // 1;

score *= 5;
score; // 5
```

Unary Operators are operators that only have one side. An example of a Unary Operator is `score++` which will add 1 to the `score` variable.

---

### Introducing Const

`const` works just like `let`, except you cannot change the value once it is set.

```js
const hens = 4;
hens = 20; // ERROR

const age = 17;
age += 1; // ERROR
```

So then why would one use const? Here are some example scenarios.

```js
const pi = 3.14159;
const daysInWeek = 7;
const minHeightForRide = 60;
```

---

### The Legacy of Var

Before `let` and `const`, `var` was the only way of declaring variables. These days, there isn't really a reason to use it.

---

### Variables Quiz

Evaluate these JavaScript problems.

```js
// What is the value of eggCount
let eggCount = 42;
eggCount + 2;
// 42

// What is the value of rating after this code runs
const rating = 7.5;
rating = 8;
// Error or 7.5

// What's the value of wind_speed, and what's the issue
let wind_speed = 76;
wind_speed += 5;
wind_speed--;
// 80
// snake_case instead of camelCase
```

---

## How to Model Data Efficiently

### Booleans Intro

Booleans are always either true or false, there is no in-between.

Some examples of Boolean uses...

```js
let isLoggedIn = true;
let gameOver = false;
let isWaterWet = true;
```

JavaScript variables can change type. If it's originally a string, we can assign a number value to it without any problems.

---

### Strings

In JavaScript, strings are pieces of text, or strings of characters.
We wrap them in quotes, either single or double quotes, it doesn't matter as long as they start and end with the same quote value they started with.

We can also use the `typeof` operator to see what type a variable or value is.

When we add 2 strings together that's called concatenation.

---

### String Indices

Strings are indexed. Each character has a corresponding index (a positional number) that starts counting at 0.

Character can include spaces, periods, etc...

If we want to pull a certain character out of a string we can use something like... `myString[2]`

---

### String Methods

Strings come with a set of built-in methods, which are actions that can be performed on or with that particular string. String methods look like `thing.method()`.

We can do things like...

- Searching within a string
- Replacing parts of a string
- Changing case (upper/lowercase)

Strings are immutable, but the methods will still work for the first calling of the variable.

```js
let msg = "you are so grounded mr";
msg.toUpperCase();
// YOU ARE SO GROUNDED MR
msg;
// you are so grounded mr
```

If we want the changes to persist, we can reassign the variable with the string method included.

```js
let msg = "you are so grounded mr";
msg = msg.toUpperCase();
msg;
// YOU ARE SO GROUNDED MR
```

Another useful method is `.trim()`, and it just removes leading and trailing and whitespace.

Methods can be chained together, so calling `.trim().toUpperCase()` is still valid.

---

### More String Methods

Some methods accept `arguments` that modify their behavior. We pass these arguments inside of the parentheses.
`thing.method(arg)`

indexOf:

```js
let tvShow = "catdog";
tvShow.indexOf("cat"); // 0
tvShow.indexOf("dog"); // 3
tvShow.indexOf("z"); // -1 (not found)
```

slice:

```js
let str = "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious";
str.slice(0, 5); // super
str.slice(5); // califragilisticexpialidocious
```

replace:

```js
let str = "Baseball is entertaining";
str.replace("entertaining", "meh");
// Baseball is meh
```

---

### Strings Quiz

```js
// What is the value of age
const age = "5" + "4";
// 54
```

```js
// What does this evaluate to?
"pecan pie"[7];
// i
```

```js
// What does this evaluate to?
"PUP"[3];
// undefined
```

```js
// What is the value of song?
let song = "london calling";
song.toUpperCase();
// london calling
```

```js
// What is the value of cleanedInput
let userInput = " TODD@gmail.com";
let cleanedInput = userInput.trim().toLowerCase();
// todd@gmail.com
```

```js
// What is the value of index?
let park = "Yellowstone";
const index = park.indexOf("Stone");
// -1
```

```js
// What is the value of index?
let yell = "GO AWAY!!";
let index = yell.indexOf(!!);
// 7
```

```js
// What does this evaluate to?
"GARBAGE!".slice(2).replace("B", "");
// RAGE!
```

---

### String Escape Characters

String Escapes:

- \n = newline
- \` = single quote
- \" = double quote
- \\ = backslash

[MDN Escape Characters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)

---

### String Template Literals

Template literals are strings that allow embedded expressions, which will be evaluated and then turned into a resulting string.
Template literals use back-ticks, not single quotes.

```js
`I counted ${3 + 4} sheep`; // I counted 7 sheep
```

Variables and simple JavaScript code can also be added into the template literal and they will be added into or modify the string.

```js
let userName = "Nicker";
`Welcome back, ${userName}`; // Welcome back Nicker
`GAME OVER ${userName.toUpperCase()}`; // GAME OVER NICKER
```

When we add a variable into our string we are interpolating.

Another Example:

```js
let item = "Carrot";
let price = 1.99;
let quantity = 4;

`You bought ${quantity} ${item}s, total price: $${price * quantity}`;
// You bought 4 Carrot, total price: $7.96
```

---

### Null & Undefined

Null:

- "Intentional absence of any value"
- Must be assigned

Undefined:

- Variables that do not have an assigned value are undefined

---

### The Math Object & Random Numbers

The `Math` object contains properties and methods for mathematical constants and functions.

```js
Math.PI; // 3.141592653589793

// Rounding a number:
Math.round(4.9); // 5

// Absolute value:
Math.abs(-456); // 456

// Raises 2 to the 5th power:
Math.pow(2, 5); // 32

// Removes decimal:
Math.floor(3.9999); // 3
```

Think of the math object as a collection of math equations.

Random Numbers:
`Math.random()` gives us a random decimal between 0 and 1, but not including 1 (non-inclusive).

If we wanted to generate a random number between 1 and 10:

```js
Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1;
```

---

### typeof Operator

`typeof` will return a string containing the type of whatever is referenced after the keyword.
You don't need to add parenthesis to use `typeof`. It is an operator, same as +,-,etc...

```js
typeof "Hello"; // String
typeof true; // Boolean
typeof 69; // Number
typeof undefined; // Undefined
typeof null; // Object
```

---

### parseInt & parseFloat

Used to parse strings into numbers, but watch out for NaN!

```js
parseInt("24"); // 24
parseInt("24.987"); // 24
parseInt("28dayslater"); // 28

parseFloat("24.987"); // 24.987
parseFloat("7"); // 7
parseFloat("I ate 3 shrimp"); // NaN
```

---

## Controlling Program Logic and Flow

### Making Decisions in JavaScript

There are lots of branching decisions to be made in JavaScript. Think of sign up forms, landing pages, logged in vs logged out, chess websites, YouTube playlists and likes and recommendations, etc...

Goals:

- Understand Comparison Operators
- Write Conditionals
- Work with Boolean Operators

---

### Comparison Operators

![Comparisons](./tnmjsb-cs/static/tnmjsb-cs3.png)

Simple comparison operators can compare strings. The way that JavaScript determines the value of these strings is based on Unicode Standards. If the character is found in the Unicode before another character then it has a higher value.

---

### Double Equals (==)

== (double equals):

- Checks for equality of value, but not equality of type.
- It coerces both values to the same type and then compares them.
- This can lead to some unexpected results

---

### Triple Equals (===)

Triple equals checks for equality of value and type.

```js
2 == "2"; // True
2 === "2"; // False
```

Go with triple equals!

```js
// Non equality
!=;
1 != 2; // True
// Strict non equality
!==;
1 !== 2; // True
```

Strict inequality returns true if the operands are not equal and/or not of the same type.

```js
3 !== "3"; // true
4 !== 3; // true
3 !== 3; // false
```

---

### Running Code From a Script

The console is good for writing one line JavaScript equations, but it's not how to write long JS files and web apps. To do that, we need to have a JS file and link it to an HTML file. This can be accomplished by making a file ending in `.js` and adding a `script src` attribute to the HTML.

Once the JavaScript page is linked into the HTML file, how do we get it to show data? One way of getting output is by using the `console` method. When using `console.log()` anything inside, as long as it's valid JS, will be printed into the console of the developer tools.

Some uses of `console.log()`:

```js
console.log(3 + 4);
console.error("Oh No");
console.log(6 + 9, "Ayy", true);
```

---

### if Statements

`if` statements have 3 levels. `if`, `else if`, and `else`.

`if`: Run code if a given condition is true

```js
let rating = 3;
if (rating === 3) {
  console.log("LETS GO!");
}
```

```js
let num = 7;
if (num % 2 !== 0) {
  console.log("This number is odd");
}
```

---

### else if

If not the first condition, maybe this other condition?

You can have multiple `else if`s in your if statements. `else if` is only valid if there's an `if` before it.

```js
let rating = 2;
if (rating === 3) {
  console.log("Good Job!");
} else if (rating === 2) {
  console.log("Needs Improvement!");
} else if (rating === 1) {
  console.log("Not Good!");
}
```

---

### else

If nothing else is true, run this code.

There's no need for parenthesis or arguments with `else` because the only time it runs is if nothing else in the if statement is true.

```js
let rating = 2;
if (rating === 3) {
  console.log("Good Job!");
} else if (rating === 2) {
  console.log("Needs Improvement!");
} else if (rating === 1) {
  console.log("Not Good!");
} else {
  console.log("Invalid Rating!");
}
```

---

### Nesting Conditionals

Conditionals can be nested inside of each other for more logical statements.

```js
let password = "hello kitty";

if (password.length >= 6) {
  if (password.indexOf(" ") === -1) {
    console.log("Valid Password");
  } else {
    console.log("Password is long enough, but cannot contain spaces");
  }
} else {
  console.log("Password must be longer");
}
```

---

### Truthy & Falsy Values

- All values have an inherent truthy or falsy boolean value
- Falsy values:
  - false
  - 0
  - "" (empty string)
  - null
  - undefined
  - NaN
- Everything else is truthy!

A common use for truthy and falsy values is to simply pass a variable into an `if` statement and use an else value in the case that it's false. In the example below, by not assigning `loggedInUser` a value, we are leaving it undefined, which by default is a falsy value, causing the if statement to resort to the else statement.

```js
let loggedInUser;

if (loggedInUser) {
  console.log("Logged In!");
} else {
  console.log("Please Log In!");
}
```

---

### Logical AND (&&)

Logical Operators: `&&`, `||`, and `!`.

AND (&&): Both sides must be true in order for the whole thing to be true.

```js
1 <= 4 && "a" === "a"; // true
9 > 10 && 9 >= 9; // false
"abc".length === 3 && 1 + 1 === 4; // false
```

---

### Logical OR (||)

If one side is true, the whole thing is true.
Multiple OR statements can be chained together.

```js
let age = 76;
if (age < 6 || age >= 65) {
  console.log("You get in for free!");
} else {
  console.log("That will be $10 please");
}
```

---

### NOT Operator (!)

`!expression` returns true if the expression is false.

```js
!null; // true
!(0 === 0); // false
!(3 <= 4); // false
```

A double NOT operator can be used to determine the value of something. For example, `!!null` would give us false, and this would be correct because null is a falsy value.

A real life example could look something like:

```js
if (flavor !== "grape" && flavor !== "cherry") {
  console.log("We don't have that flavor");
}
```

---

### Operator Precedence

What would be the outcome of this statement:

```js
let x = 7;
x == 7 || (x === 3 && x > 10);
```

This evaluates as true, because of the order of operator precedence.

The AND operator is first in this statement, which means it takes the left and the right and evaluates those. Once it has the value of false from the AND, it goes on to the OR operator, which has one true side and one false side which makes the whole thing true.

To check the precedence of operators, check on [this MDN page.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence)

![Operator Precedence](./tnmjsb-cs/static/tnmjsb-cs4.png)

---

### The Switch Statement

When does a switch statement come into play?

Imagine a numeric variable, say 4, that represents a day of the week. So 4 would equal Wednesday. As of now, we would probably write a day to number checker by using a ton of if and else if statements and check it against every day of the week until we find a match.

```js
switch (variableName) {
  case 1:
    console.log("Sunday");
    break;
  case 2:
    console.log("Monday");
    break;
  case false || "string":
    functionCall();
  default:
    console.log("Invalid Day");
}
```

---

### Ternary Operator

The ternary operator is a very simple operator that has just 3 pieces.

It looks something like this

`condition ? codeIfTrue : codeIfFalse`

Instead of writing this:

```js
let num = 7;
if (num === 7) {
  console.log("Lucky");
} else {
  console.log("Unlucky");
}
```

We can write it like this:

```js
num === 7 ? console.log("Lucky") : console.log("Bad");
```

What's happening is we're putting what would normally go in the `if()` parenthesis, and we're putting a question mark after that saying, if this first statement is true, then we need to run this code, otherwise do what comes after the colon.

---

## Capture Collections of Data with Arrays

### Creating Arrays

Goals:

- Work with Arrays
- Write Object Literals
- Understand Reference Types
- Use common Array/Object methods

Arrays are ordered collections of values.

- List of comments on IG post
- Collection of levels in a game
- Songs in a playlist
- Comments on Reddit or blog posts

Creating Arrays:

```js
// To make an empty array
let students = [];

// An array of strings
let colors = ["red", "orange", "yellow"];

// An array of numbers
let lottoNums = [19, 22, 56, 12, 51];

// A mixed array
let stuff = [true, 68, "cat", null];
```

---

### Array Indices

Arrays are indexed. The index numbering starts at 0, but if something like `.length` is called it will count from 1.

```js
let colors = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green"];
colors.length; // 4
colors[0]; // red
colors[1]; // orange
colors[2]; // yellow
colors[3]; // green
colors[4]; // undefined
```

---

### Modifying Arrays

Arrays are mutable, meaning we can change the original Array value.

If we wanted to change a value that is already in an Array, we can just reassign the value of the array.

```js
let shoppingList = ["Lactaid", "Almondoss"];
shoppingList[1] = "Almonds";
shoppingList; // Lactaid, Almonds
```

---

### Push and Pop

Array Methods:

- push - add to end
- pop - remove from end
- shift - remove from start
- unshift - add to start

When we call one of these Array methods, we are mutating the original array. If `pop()` is called numerous times, then the original Array is losing all of the values stored inside because we are actually editing the Array.

---

### Shift and Unshift

Array Methods:

- push - add to end
- pop - remove from end
- shift - remove from start
- unshift - add to start

Unshift can include multiple items, but the behavior when using unshift for one vs multiple items is different. If it's one item, it's added to the front like we would expect. If it's multiple items, they're added as a block in the same order that you wrote them.

---

### Concat

More Array Methods:

- concat - merge arrays
- includes - look for a value
- indexOf - just like str.indexOf
- join - creates a string from arr
- reverse - reverses an array
- slice - copy portion of an arr
- splice - remove/replace elements
- sort - sorts an array

concat is used to merge two or more arrays.

```js
let fruits = ["apple", "banana"];
let veggies = ["brussel sprouts", "carrots"];
console.log(fruits.concat(veggies));
// apple, banana, brussel sprouts, carrots
```

concat can take multiple arrays as arguments if needed.

---

### Includes and IndexOf

`includes` simply checks if there's a specific value in an array. It doesn't recognize values that only include part of an argument, like searching for corn in corn starch would not return anything.

`indexOf` returns a numeric value of where the value is in the array, starting from 0.

---

### Reverse and Join

`Array.reverse()` reverses the original Array. The first array element becomes the last, and the last array element becomes the first.

`Array.join()` will insert a character between every value of the array. If numbers are joined to the array they will be automatically converted into strings.

---

### Slice

`slice()` doesn't modify the original array because it returns a new array.
The counting is a bit strange, slice() starts counting from 0 on the first number but then if you want another value to be included you go past that, or, after the first number you start counting from 1 instead.

If a negative number is selected, it will start counting from the end of the array.

Calling slice() without any parameters makes a new copy of the array, this is something people will do to make a quick copy.

---

### Splice

The `splice()` method changes the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing elements and/or adding new elements in place.

The syntax is, start count, delete count, item to add.

Notes available with video [Splice](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-beginners-complete-tutorial/learn/lecture/16981354#overview)

---

### Sorting (Part 1)

The `sort()` method sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the sorted array. The default sort order is ascending, built upon converting the elements into strings, then comparing their sequences of UTF-16 code units values.

Most people don't use array.sort() as-is, instead, a function is usually passed in which will give more control over how the array items are sorted. We will come back to sorting after the functions module.

---

### Intro to Reference Types

There's a difference in the way that primitive types and value types variables work with reference types. For example, strings are primitive types and are not updated through variable paths, like shown.

```js
let fruit = "orange";
let color = fruit;
fruit = "watermelon";
console.log(fruit, color);
// Watermelon, Orange
```

However, the case is different with arrays and objects

```js
let nums = [5, 6, 7, 8];
let otherNums = nums;
nums.push(9);
console.log(otherNums);
// 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
```

To sum it up, primitive types are stored as the actual value in a variable. Arrays are different, instead the variable stores a reference to where that array is in memory.

### Using Const with Arrays

Using const, we can't reassign the value of a variable because it is a constant. We can however, change the value. We can change the value as long as the reference remains the same.

```js
const myEggs = ["brown", "white"];
myEggs.push("brown");
```

Here we are changing the value in the array but not reassigning anything.

---

### Working with Nested Arrays

Arrays can easily be nested inside each other. You can have an array that contains another array, then a boolean, then a number, then another array, because it's just treated as another value in the array.

To access values in nested arrays, just use 2 indexes.

```js
const animalPairs = [
  ["doe", "buck"],
  ["ewe", "ram"],
  ["peahen", "peacock"]
];
console.log(animalPairs[2][1]);
// peacock
```

A good example of a nested array would be a tic tac toe board.

```js
const board = [
  ["0", null, "X"],
  [null, "X", "0"],
  ["X", "0", null]
];
```

---

## Objects - The Core of JavaScript

### Intro to Objects

Arrays are great for when you have some ordered information, but what if you have a dashboard for some information.
An object lets us group pieces of data together and it allows us to specify labels.

Objects:

- Objects are collections of properties
- Properties are a key-value pair
- Rather than accessing data using an index, we use custom keys

Objects are sometimes called dictionaries, because you have the word you're looking for, and then you go find the value of the word in the dictionary.

Object syntax looks something like this

```js
const fitBitData = {
  totalSteps: 308727,
  totalMiles: 211.7,
  avgCalorieBurn: 5755,
  workoutsThisWeek: "5 of 7",
  avgGoodSleep: "2:13"
};
```

---

### Creating Object Literals

```js
const fitBitData = {
  totalSteps: 308727,
  totalMiles: 211.7,
  avgCalorieBurn: 5755,
  workoutsThisWeek: "5 of 7",
  avgGoodSleep: "2:13"
};
```

One way to access data from an object is to use the dot syntax.
`fitBitData.totalMiles // 211.7`

All keys are converted to strings \* except for symbols, which we haven't covered yet.

Order is not crucial with objects, they are usually sorted alphabetically by the browser but if we need an ordered list of data then we use an array.

Just be sure to add a comma when you're done with the property so it knows to separate the properties.

---

### Accessing Object Properties

If we use a number as our key in the key value pair, we can't access that key using the dot notation. We can try and access it using the bracket notation. Objects turn all the keys into strings so we could use a string number value or a real number value in the bracket notation.

```js
const numbers = {
  100: "one hundred",
  200: "two hundred"
};
console.log(numbers[200]); // Or "200" as a string
```

When else would we use the square bracket notation? If we were using a variable of if we had a key that was a string with spaces or started with a number. When using this notation be sure to access your keys using strings.

---

### Adding and Updating Properties

How do we add or update a property on an object? There are 2 ways, we have the square bracket notation or we have the dot notation.

```js
const userReviews = {};
userReviews.colt = 5.0;
userReviews["colt steele"] = 50;
console.log(userReviews);
```

When we're using the square bracket notation we have to use a string when referencing our key.

---

### Nested Arrays & Objects

If we want to access data that is nested we can just go down the line and find it. `students.nick.math.grade` or `students.nick.math[0]`.

A common nesting pattern is to use an array and inside the array add objects. This is useful for a shopping cart array or something, because it keeps the data ordered but also allows key value pairs that are useful for describing products.

---

### Objects and Reference Types

Objects are reference types, think of it like an address. When we define a const and a variable for a object, the variable is not storing the values of the object it's simply storing the address to where the values are located. So when we set another const equal to the original object and change the second one, it will change things for the first one because they are both pointing to the same address.

---

### Array / Object Equality

What if we had 2 arrays that looked exactly the same, and we tried to compare them with double or triple equals?
They wouldn't be equal, we would get false. The reason that it would return false is because of reference types, remember the values aren't stored in the variable name but the address is, so even if it looks the same it will have a different address because it is a different variable.

## The World of Loops

### Intro to Loops

Goals:

- Write for loops
- Write while loops
- Avoid infinite loops
- Iterate over arrays and objects

Loops: Doing things repeatedly

- Loops allow us to repeat code
  - Print "Hello" 10 times
  - Sum all numbers in an array
- There are multiple types:
  - for loo
  - while loop
  - for...of loop
  - for...in loop

An example of this is Reddit. Each post in an objects and a key would be something like username, another key would be title, etc... and all these posts (objects) are contained in an array. That array is then looped over and HTML is made for each object in the array.

Another example is the game 2048. There's a loop that runs on every key press and as long as there's moves available to be completed, it will keep running... otherwise if there's no movements available, the loop ends.

---

### For Loops

A for loop is similar to a conditional, here's some example syntax.

`for([initialExpression];[condition];[incrementExpression])`

```js
for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
  console.log("Hello!");
}
// (10)Hello!
```

---

### Infinite Loops!

An infinite loop is when you write a loop where the conditional will never be true. If in infinite loop happens, the browser will lag out and eventually ask if you want to kill the task.
Here's an example.

```js
for (let i = 1; i >= 0; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
```

---

### For Loops & Arrays

There are many use cases where we would need to loop over an array using a for loop.

```js
const myStudents = [
  {
    firstName: "Zeus",
    grade: 86
  },
  {
    firstName: "Artemis",
    grade: 97
  },
  {
    firstName: "Hera",
    grade: 72
  },
  {
    firstName: "Apollo",
    grade: 90
  }
];

for (let i = 0; i < myStudents.length; i++) {
  let student = myStudents[i];
  console.log(`${student.firstName} scored ${student.grade}`);
}
```

---

### Nested For Loops

For loops can be nested inside of each other, and if the first for loop runs, then the second one can run. However, once the second for loop starts running it will need to loop over everything before the next for loop can start again.
An example of where we could use nested for loops is adding numbers in an array box.

```js
const gameBoard = [
  [4, 32, 8, 4],
  [64, 8, 32, 2],
  [8, 32, 16, 4],
  [2, 8, 4, 2]
];
let totalScore = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < gameBoard.length; i++) {
  let row = gameBoard.length;
  for (let j = 0; j < row.length; j++) {
    totalScore += row[j];
  }
}
console.log(totalScore);
```

---

### Intro to While Loops

A While Loop continues to run as long as its test condition is true.

With a while loop, we have to define the variable outside of the loop and increment it inside of the loop, so it is a bit messier than a for loop.

for vs while:

```js
for (let i = 0; i <= 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}

let i = 0;
while (i <= 5) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}
```

---

### More While Loops

While loops are great for a situation where we don't know how many times we need to loop, but we know we need to keep looping until a situation is met.

For example, a random number target and a random number that tries to guess that target number, so while the random number is trying to get the target it needs to just keep guessing.

```js
const target = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10);
let guess;
while (guess !== target) {
  guess = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10);
}
console.log(target + guess);
```

---

### Break Keyword

There's a keyword called `break` that allows us to break out of loops and stop the exectuion whenever JavaScript comes across it.
It's not super common to use break because we define our own rules when writing loops so we should be able to end our own loops.

If you have a nested loop and break in the nested loop it doesn't break all the loops above.

One use case is with a while loop. You could say `while(true)` to keep the loop running until we make a break statement.

---

### For...Of Intro

The `for of` method helps us write cleaner for loops over iterable things.

For vs For Of:

```js
let subreddits = ["soccer", "popheads", "cringe", "books"];
for (i = 0; i < subreddits.length; i++) {
  console.log(subreddits[i]);
}

//

for (let subs of subreddits) {
  console.log(subs);
}
```

What's happening is that we're assigning a variable to hold all the data from when we loop over the iterable. So in this case we are assigning `subs` to hold all the data we get when we loop over `subreddits`.

---

### Comparing For and For...Of

There are different situations where we would use for vs for of. If we need the exact index of something in an array and we're comparing that index to another index in another array it would be easier to use a for loop. If we just have one array that we're looping over, a for of loop might be easier.

---

### For...Of with Objects

If we try to use `for...of` to iterate over a regular object, we get an error saying that the object is not iterable.

We have 2 properties available to help us with objects. `Object.keys()` will give us an array containing strings of all the keys in the object. `Object.values()` will give us an array containing all the values.

So how can we loop over objects using these methods?

```js
let movies = {
  "Game of Thrones": 9.8,
  "Mr. Robot": 7.8
};
const keys = Object.keys(movies);
const values = Object.values(movies);
for (let movie of keys) {
  console.log(movie + " " + movies[movie]);
}
```

---

### For...In Loops

The For...In loop loops over the keys in an object.
This is very similar to the `Object.keys` method we used earlier but this will automatically loop over the keys for us.

```js
const jeopardyWinnings = {
  regularPlay: 2522700,
  watsonChallenge: 300000,
  tournamentOfChampions: 500000,
  battleOfTheDecades: 100000
};

for (let prop in jeopardyWinnings) {
  console.log(`${prop} = $${jeopardyWinnings[prop]}`);
}
```

---

## Writing Reusable Code with Functions

### Our First Function!

Goals:

- Write valid functions
- Write functions with arguments
- Compare function expressions & function statements
- Write a bunch of functions!

Functions are reusable procedures

- Functions allow us to write reusable, modular code
- We define a "chunk" of code that we can then execute at a later point
- We use them ALL THE TIME

First we define a function, which is kind of like registering our function. Then we run our function.

The first kind of function we'll define is a function declaration, or a function statement.
`function funcName(){//code}`

After we write our function, we have to call it for it to run. We can call it by writing the function name with parenthesis. `funcName()`

---

### Dice Roll Function

```js
function rollDie() {
  let roll = Math.floor(Math.random() * (7 - 1) + 1);
  console.log(roll);
}
rollDie();
```

We can also call function within other functions.

```js
function rollDie() {
  let roll = Math.floor(Math.random() * (7 - 1) + 1);
  console.log(roll);
}
function throwDice() {
  for (i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
    rollDie();
  }
}
throwDice();
```

---

### Introducing Arguments

Right now, our simple functions accept zero inputs. They behave the same way every time.

If we want to make our functions dynamic and change based on the content we give it, we need to add an argument. We do this by adding a temporary placeholder "variable" of sorts in the parenthesis of the function name.

```js
function greet(nickname) {
  console.log(`Hi there ${nickname}!`);
}
greet("Nick");
```

---

### Functions With Multiple Arguments

The correct terminology for functions is as follows.
When we're writing our function and we give it that temporary variable name, that's called the `parameter`. When we're calling our function and adding data to our parameter, that's called an `argument`.

```js
function divide(a, b) {
  console.log(a / b);
}
divide(1, 4);
```

There are a few problems with the following function. The first problem is that if we input a string or a different type than number, we get `NaN` back, and if we don't put in our second argument, we will get undefined.

---

### The Return Statement

Built-in methods return values when we call them. We can store those values.

Right now, our functions are printing out data but not actually storing any data as a return value. All we have to do to get a return value, we just use the `return` keyword.

```js
function add(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}
const total = add(5, 5);
// total = 10
```

`return` can only return one value, even though there can be multiple return statements in a function.

---

### More on Return Values

The `return` statement ends function execution and specifies the value ot be returned by that function.

Here's an example of a function that can be greatly shortened by making use of the return keyword.

```js
function isPurple(color) {
  if (color.toLowerCase() === "purple") {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}

//

function isPurple(color) {
  return color.toLowerCase() === "purple";
}
```

These two functions will do the same thing but one is much shorter. The reason why the second one can be so much shorter is because a return statement will always stop the flow of code once it is reached, and we're asking it to return a value based on some expression so there's only two options anyways.

How would we make a loop that goes over an array of colors that returns true if it contains purple but will return false if a given color is not found after looping through the whole array.

```js
function containsPurple(array) {
  for (let color of array) {
    if (color === "purple" || color === "magenta") {
      return true;
    }
  }
  return false;
}
let array = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "purple"];
containsPurple(array);
```

---

### Function Challenge 1: passwordValidator

In this challenge we were told to write a `isValidPassword` function. It will accept 2 arguments: password and username. The password must be at least 8 characters, not contain spaces, and cannot contain the username. If all requirements are met, return true, otherwise return false.

```js
function isValidPassword(password, username) {
  if (password.length < 8) {
    return console.log(false);
  } else if (password.indexOf(" ") !== -1) {
    return console.log(false);
  } else if (password.includes(username) === true) {
    return console.log(false);
  }
  return console.log(true);
}
isValidPassword("chicken1234", "1chicken");
// true
```

We also could have written this using conditional logic (|| &&) in a if statement.
We also could have written this using variable that store true or false based on our requirements.

---

### Function Challenge 2: Average

In this challenge we were told to write a `average` function to find the average value in an array of numbers. I did this using a regular for loop as well as a messy forEach function.

```js
let averageArray = [32, 46, 12, 64, 45, 89, 3, 45, 268, 1, 108, 352];
function average(array) {
  let sum = 0;
  let num = array.length;
  let average = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    sum += array[i];
    average = sum / num;
  }
  console.log(
    `There are ${num} numbers in the array.
     The sum of the array is ${sum}.
     The average value is ${average}`
  );
  return average;
}

average([32, 46, 12, 23, 45, 89, 3, 45, 268, 7, 1, 108, 352]);

// There are 13 numbers in the array.
// The sum of the array is 1031.
// The average value is 79.3076923076923
// return value = 79.3076923076923
```

We don't need both the `averageArray` array and an array in the function but either will return the same result.

---

### Function Challenge 3: Pangrams

Write a function called isPangram, which checks to see if a given sentence
contains every letter of the alphabet. Make sure you ignore string casing!

```js
function isPangram(sentence) {
  let lowerCase = sentence.toLowerCase();
  for (let char of "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz") {
    if (lowerCase.indexOf(char) === -1) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  return true;
}
isPangram("Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs");
```

---

### Function Challenge 4: Get Playing Card

```js
function getCard() {
  let deck = {
    value: [
      "2",
      "3",
      "4",
      "5",
      "6",
      "7",
      "8",
      "9",
      "10",
      "Jack",
      "Queen",
      "King",
      "Ace"
    ],
    suit: ["Clubs", "Spades", "Hearts", "Diamonds"]
  };
  let randomValue = Math.floor(Math.random() * 13);
  let randomSuit = Math.floor(Math.random() * 4);
  console.log("Hey");
  return `The card that has been chosen is: ${deck.value[randomValue]} of ${deck.suit[randomSuit]}`;
  // return { suit: deck.suit[randomSuit], value: deck.value[randomValue] };
}
getCard();
```

---

## An Advanced Look at Functions

### Function Scope

Goals:

- Understand scope
- Write higher order functions
- Pass functions as callbacks

Scope:
Variable "visibility"

- The location where a variable is defined dictates where we have access to that variable.

Function Scope:

```js
let bird = "mandarin duck";
function birdWatch() {
  let bird = "golden pheasant";
  bird; // golden pheasant
}
bird; // mandarin duck
```

The variable `msg` has been declared in the function scope and is available for anything in the function, but when we try to access it outside of the function it's undefined because it's not available in the global scope.

---

### Block Scope

In the case of a block statement, maybe like an if statement, any variables inside of that will be scoped to the block statement.

```js
if (true) {
  let animal = "eel";
}
console.log(animal);
// animal is not defined
```

If we did this same code block using `var`, we would get different results because var is not scoped to the block statement which it is defined in.

---

### Lexical Scope

If we have nested functions and we declare variables in the parent function, we still have access to the variable in the inside function.

```js
function outer() {
  let movie = "Tiger";
  function inner() {
    console.log(movie.toUpperCase());
  }
  inner();
}
outer();
// TIGER
```

This is a one way relationship, if we define a variable inside the inner function, we cannot access it from the outer function.

```js
function outer() {
  console.log(movie);
  function inner() {
    let movie = "nicker";
  }
  inner();
}
outer();
// movie is not defined
```

If we have multiple nested functions, and the function needs to look up for a variable that is declared somewhere above it, it will stop at the first one it finds.

---

### Function Expressions

So far, we've been defining our functions using function statements, which is where we do something like `function add(){}`.

But there's another way we can define a function, we can use a function expression.

```js
const square = function(num) {
  return num * num;
};
square(5); // 25
```

The reason we can define a function like this, is because functions are technically just objects. This means that we can store them in variables.

The ES6 method of arrow functions often follows this same syntax.

```js
const square = num => {
  return num * num;
};
square(5); // 25
```

---

### Higher Order Functions

Functions are objects. This means that we can hold the references in arrays or objects, and loop over each function, and call they dynamically, etc...

By adding a function to an object, we are creating a `method`.

---

### Functions as Arguments

Higher Order Functions: Functions that operate on/with other functions.
These higher order functions can:

- Accept other functions as arguments
- Return a function

Functions as arguments:

```js
function callTwice(func) {
  func();
  func();
}

function laugh() {
  console.log("HAHAHA");
}

callTwice(laugh);
```

If we have a function that we want to call x number of times we can initiate a for loop that will loop through a given amount of times, say as many times as the number we give it which is a parameter, and call the function through on each loop.

---

### Functions as Return Values

We can call / define functions as return values.

```js
function makeBetweenFunc(min, max) {
  return function(val) {
    return val >= min && val <= max;
  };
}
const inAgeRange = makeBetweenFunc(18, 100);
inAgeRange(17); // false
inAgeRange(68); // true
```

---

### Callbacks

A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function.

Sometimes, instead of passing in a function that we have already written as a callback function, we could pass in an anonymous function.

```js
setTimeout(function() {
  alert("Hello");
}, 5000);
```

---

### Hoisting

When we try to run some code that looks like this...

```js
console.log(animal);
var animal = "Doggo";
// Undefined
```

What JavaScript is actually doing looks more like this...

```js
var animal;
console.log(animal);
animal = "Doggo";
```

This is because it will "hoist" `var` to the top, but won't bring the values up to the top.

If we tried to do the same thing with `let` that we did with `var`, we would get a `ReferenceError` saying that we cannot access the variable before initialization.

This means that `let` and `const` are not hoisted, meaning they won't be brought up to the top to be accessed.

Functions however, are hoisted. You can define a function and call a function from anywhere in the script. But, if we use a function expression, aka a function stored in a variable, there is no hoisting to be found.

---

## Apply Functions to Collections of Data

### Intro to Array Callback Methods

Array Callback Methods:

- Arrays come with many built-in methods that accept callback functions
- Now that we've covered callbacks, we can learn these methods!
- SUPER USEFUL!

Goals:

- Use the new arrow function syntax
- Understand and use these methods:
  - forEach
  - map
  - filter
  - find
  - reduce
  - some
  - every

---

### forEach

`forEach` accepts a callback function. Calls the function once per element in the array.

```js
const nums = [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1];

nums.forEach(function(n) {
  console.log(n * n);
});

nums.forEach(function(el) {
  if (el % 2 === 0) {
    console.log(el);
  }
});
```

We can also use a second parameter in a `forEach` loop which will automatically give us the index.

```js
nums.forEach(function(num, index) {
  console.log(num, index);
});
```

---

### Map

`map` creates a new array with the results of calling a callback on every element in the array.

```js
const texts = ["rofl", "lol", "omg", "ttyl"];
const caps = texts.map(function(t) {
  return t.toUpperCase();
});
// texts = ["rofl", "lol", "omg", "ttyl"];
// caps = ["ROFL", "LOL", "OMG", "TTYL"];
```

`forEach` is something similar that we've seen to map, it is different however in the fact that `map` will return us a new array containing all the values we mapped over.

---

### Arrow Functions Intro

Arrow functions are a syntactically compact alternative to a regular function expression.

A simple example...

```js
const square = x => {
  return x * x;
};

const sum = (x, y) => {
  return x + y;
};
```

Parentheses are optional if there is only one parameter.
Use empty parentheses for functions with no parameters.

---

### Arrow Functions: Implicit Returns

Implicit returns allows us to write an arrow function that is even smaller than a typical arrow function. We can use an implicit return in a scenario where we have 1 expression that we want to be returned, we can return that without a return statement.

```js
// Arrow Function w/ return
const square = x => {
  return x * x;
};

// Arrow Function w/o return
const square = x => x * x;
```

---

### Array.find

`Array.find` returns the value of the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function.

```js
let movies = [
  "The Fantastic Mr. Fox",
  "Mr. and Mrs. Smith",
  "Mrs. Doubtfire",
  "Mr. Deeds"
];

let movie = movies.find(movie => {
  return movie.includes("Mrs.");
});
// Mr. and Mrs. Smith

let movie2 = movies.find(m => m.indexOf("Mrs") === 0);
// Mrs. Doubtfire
```

Instead of simply storing true or false, we can think of `.find()` as more of a testing suite. We pass in some value we want our answer to contain, and if something matches that value and returns true, we get the whole value as opposed to a boolean, which we can then store into a variable.

---

### Filter

Creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provider function.

```js
const nums = [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1];
const odds = nums.filter(n => {
  return n % 2 === 1;
});
// odds = [9, 7, 5, 3, 1]
```

---

### Some & Every

`every` tests whether all elements in the array pass the provided function. It returns a boolean value.

```js
const words = ["dog", "dig", "log", "bag", "wag"];

words.every(word => {
  return word.length === 3;
}); // true

words.every(word => word[0] === "d"); // false

words.every(w => {
  let lastLetter = w[w.length - 1];
  return lastLetter === "g";
}); // true
```

`some` is similar to `every`, but returns true if ANY of the array elements pass the test function.

```js
const words = ["dog", "jello", "log", "cupcake", "bag", "wag"];

words.some(word => {
  return word.length === 3;
}); // true

words.some(word => word[0] === "z"); // false

words.some(w => w.includes("cake")); // true
```

---

### Revisiting Sort!

Sort Pt. 2

`arr.sort(compareFunc(a,b))`

- If `compareFunc(a,b)` returns less than 0
  - Sort `a` before `b`
- If `compareFunc(a,b)` returns 0
  - Leave `a` and `b` unchanged with respect to each other
- If `compareFunc(a,b)` returns greater than 0
  - Sort `b` before `a`

When we sort our array, we are modifying the original array "in place". If we wanted to create a copy of an array and not touch the original, we could add `.slice()` in to make a copy.

---

### Reduce Intro

`reduce` executes a reducer function on each element of the array, resulting in a single value.

You can think of it with these examples.
`reduce` could be used to take an array of 100 numbers and reduce those numbers into one number. The one number being the maximum value if you added them all together.

![Summing an array](/img/tnmjsb-cs/tnmjsb-cs1.png)

We have 2 parameters when using `reduce`.
The first one is known as accumulator or total, and this first one will store the end result of reduce.

The second one is called currentValue, or val and this represents each individual element as reduce goes through all the options.

What if we wanted to take an array of numbers and return one number which is the result of multiplying every number.

```js
const nums = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];
const total = nums.reduce((total, currentVal) => {
  return total * currentVal;
});
// 181440
```

---

### Reduce Pt. 2

What if we had an array of numbers and we wanted to find the largest number and return said number. We could use a reduce function.

```js
const grades = [87, 64, 96, 92, 88, 99, 73, 70, 64];
const maxGrade = grades.reduce((max, currentVal) => {
  if (currentVal > max) return currentVal;
  return max;
});
// 99
```

An alternative to this would be to use `Math.max()` which takes some numbers and returns the largest number.

One other thing you can do with reduce is define your own starting value at the end of the function.

```js
[4, 5, 6, 7, 8].reduce((max, current) => {
  return max + current;
}, 100);
// 130
```

---

### Even More Reduce!
